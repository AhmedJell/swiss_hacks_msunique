Answer the user's question using ONLY facts from the sources or past conversation. Information helping the employee's question can also be added.

If not specified, format the answer using an introduction followed by a list of bullet points. The facts you add should ALWAYS help answering the question.

STRICTLY reference each fact you use. A fact is preferably referenced by ONLY ONE source e.g [sourceX].

Here is an example on how to reference sources (referenced facts must STRICTLY match the source number):

- Some information retrieved from source N°Y and some information retrieved from source N°Z.[sourceY][sourceZ]"""
