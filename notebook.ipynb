       " '\\n\\n\\n—\\nCHAIRMAN AND CEO LETTER\\nDear shareholders, customers,\\npartners and employees,\\n===\\nThe year 2021 was also characterized by uncer-\\ntainty related to the continuing impacts of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, especially in the second half.\\nAlthough demand increased significantly, as can\\nbe seen in ABB\\'s order performance, broad disrup-\\ntions in the global supply chain - including com-\\nponent shortages, challenging logistics and tight\\nlabor markets - hampered our ability to convert\\nstrong order intake into actual customer deliveries.\\nWe expect supply-chain problems to ease during\\nthe course of this year, and while rising inflation is\\na concern, it seems likely that the era of ultra-loose\\nmonetary policy is coming to an end, which is good\\nnews for the economy.\\nWhen it comes to longer-term trends, ABB is well-\\npositioned in very attractive markets. Despite\\nthe absence of a global agreement on actions to\\nachieve the Paris climate goal, the COP26 climate\\nconference showed that reducing emissions and\\nmaking more efficient use of resources are now a\\nmust for governments and businesses. For ABB, as\\na provider of electrification, automation and digital\\ntechnologies, this represents a huge opportunity.\\nDemand for electricity is growing twice as fast as\\nfor any other form of energy and software-driven\\nautomation is the most effective way to improve\\nenergy and resource efficiency.\\n## Positioned for stronger growth\\nIn 2021, ABB started to reap the benefits of its on-\\ngoing transformation. Improved efficiency com-\\nbined with higher demand resulted in a significant\\nincrease in orders as well as a marked improve-\\nment in profitability. In our Business Areas, we ad-\\nvanced on several fronts, with the launch of im-\\nportant innovations for the transport sector and\\nthe mining industry, a value-adding acquisition in\\nrobotics, and the divestment of our Dodge busi-\\nness (Mechanical Power Transmission Division) for\\n$2.9 billion in cash.\\nWe made good progress in building a high-perfor-\\nmance culture by empowering our Divisions, and\\nwe initiated several important actions to reduce\\nour own CO2 emissions and make ABB a more at-\\ntractive employer. These achievements, which are\\ncovered in more detail below and in the follow-\\ning pages, provide a solid foundation for future\\nprofitability and growth. They will also help to\\nstrengthen ABB\\'s position in key market segments\\nas well as contribute to sustainable development.\\nIn short, our company is now moving forward\\nstrongly and with a clear purpose and direction.\\nTragically, over the course of the year, we lost sev-\\neral colleagues due to continued outbreaks of\\nCOVID-19. However, our high level of prepared-\\nness helped us protect our people and keep our\\noperations running. Thanks to our strong focus on\\nsafety, we saw a further reduction in workplace in-\\njuries and recorded no fatalities for the first time\\nsince 2011.\\n### Financial performance\\nOur strong financial performance in 2021 showed\\nthat our \"ABB Way\" operating model, introduced\\nin 2020, is the right one for our company. All of our\\nfour Business Areas contributed to strong order\\ngrowth as well as increased profitability. We also\\nimproved cash flow and strengthened our balance\\nsheet. For the full-year 2021, Group orders were up\\n20 percent, revenues rose by 11 percent, and we in-\\ncreased our operational EBITA margin by 3.1 per-\\ncent to 14.2 percent.\\nOur order backlog increased, driven in part by\\nstrong demand and but also due to supply-chain\\nchallenges hampering customer deliveries. We\\nwere able to mitigate some of them thanks to our\\nglobal footprint and multiple sourcing strategy,\\nbut a worldwide shortage of semi-conductors, im-\\npacted logistics and a tight labor market in the\\nUnited States meant that deliveries to customers\\nwere delayed starting in the third quarter. We ex-\\npect the situation to ease over the course of this\\nyear.\\nIn light of our improved financial results, and in line\\nwith our policy of paying a sustainable dividend\\nover time, we will be proposing a dividend of CHF\\n0.82 per share to our shareholders to be voted on\\nat the annual general meeting on March 24, 2022.\\nAt the AGM, we will also ask our shareholders to\\napprove the cancellation of shares purchased\\nthrough a second buyback program that was\\nlaunched on April 9, 2021. The buybacks are to re-\\nturn $7.8 billion of cash proceeds from the Power\\nGrids divestment to shareholders. We will also\\nseek shareholder approval for the cancellation of\\nshares purchased under the initial buyback pro-\\ngram that were not proposed for cancellation at\\nABB\\'s 2021 AGM.\\n## Cultural change\\nA key objective of our transformation is to build\\na high-performance culture by empowering our',\n",

Under our decentralized ABB Way op-\\nerating model, performance is measured through\\na scorecard system, which provides full transpar-\\nency on key measures.\\nTo be able to deliver on our commitments to our\\nstakeholders, our Divisions are required to be sta-\\nble and profitable before focusing on growth. At\\nthe end of 2021, around 60 percent of our Divisions\\nwere in growth mode, which means that they focus\\nboth on organic growth as well as M&A opportuni-\\nties to consolidate their market position.\\nOur long-term objective is to shift to more attrac-\\ntive markets, with better quality of revenues, which\\nmeans better gross margins, less risk and lower\\nearnings volatility. Among the high-growth seg-\\nments we are targeting are: water and wastewater,\\nfood and beverage, sustainable transport and data\\ncenters. We aim to be number 1 or 2 in all of our\\ncustomer segments.\\n## Strengthening our portfolio\\nTo further strengthen our position in electrification\\nand automation, we pursue a strategy of active\\nportfolio management with the aim of making at\\nleast five small- to mid-sized acquisitions per year.\\nIn 2021, we acquired leading autonomous mobile\\nrobot manufacturer ASTI Mobile Robotics Group,\\nwhich will help us to capture growing potential in\\nareas such as logistics and warehouse automation.\\nWith ASTI, we now have the most comprehensive\\nportfolio of industrial robots on the market.\\nIn January 2022, we strengthened our E-mobility\\nbusiness by taking a controlling stake in United\\nStates electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure company,\\nIn-Charge Energy, as well as increasing our majority\\nstake in Chinese EV charging provider, Chargedot',\n",

We successfully closed the divestment\\nof the Mechanical Power Transmission Division\\n(Dodge) on November 1. This marks the completion\\nof the announced first step to focus our business\\nportfolio on our leading position in electrification\\nand automation. As part of these actions, we have\\nappointed a new head of the Turbocharging Divi-\\nsion ahead of a likely spin off.\\n## Groundbreaking innovations\\nIn 2021, ABB again demonstrated its capacity for\\ngroundbreaking innovation with the launch of sev-\\neral new solutions that will further drive the shift\\nto electrification and automation and contribute to\\na low-carbon society.\\nOne notable example from our E-mobility Division\\nwas the Terra 360, the world\\'s fastest electric-ve-\\nhicle charger, capable of providing enough charge\\nfor 100 km of driving in less than three minutes,\\nor of fully charging an EV in less than 15 minutes.\\nDesigned for commercial fleets and heavy-duty\\nvehicles as well as electric cars, the Terra 360 has\\nthe capacity to charge up to four vehicles simulta-\\nneously and can be installed in almost any setting\\nfrom the curbside to gas stations and motorway\\nstops.\\n## Progress on sustainability\\nIn 2021, we began implementing our 2030 sustain-\\nability strategy, with the focus on reducing CO2\\nemissions across our value chain. In the past two\\nyears, we have reduced emissions from our own\\noperations by 39 percent, in part by using our own\\ntechnologies. To achieve our goal of carbon neu-\\ntrality by 2030, we committed to electrifying our\\nvehicle fleet, sourcing 100 percent of our energy\\nfrom renewables and installing energy manage-\\nment systems at our sites around the world. Our\\ncarbon-neutrality commitment was verified by the\\nScience-Based Targets initiative as being in line\\nwith the 1.5℃ scenario of the Paris Agreement.\\nTo help our customers reduce their CO2 emissions -\\nanother key target of our 2030 sustainability strat-\\negy - we have identified products and solutions\\nfrom our portfolio that deliver the most significant\\nreductions in CO2 emissions. At the core of our\\noffering are our energy-efficient electric motors\\nand drives produced by our Motion Business Area.\\nDrives can reduce the power consumption of mo-\\ntors by up to 25 percent and the Motion Business\\nArea\\'s flagship synchronous reluctance (SynRM)\\nmotor and drive package has set a new standard\\nfor energy efficiency. Thanks to its innovative mag-\\nnet-free design, the SynRM motor also requires no\\nrare-earth materials in its manufacture, further re-\\nducing resource consumption.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nAlongside reducing CO2 emissions, we also have\\nthe goal of preserving resources for future gener-\\nations. In December 2021, we unveiled a new com-\\npany-wide approach to drive circularity in our own\\nand our customers\\' operations. By 2030, at least\\n80 percent of ABB\\'s products and solutions will be\\nevaluated against a clear set of key performance\\nindicators (KPIs), corresponding to each stage of\\nthe product lifecycle. We will also send no waste to\\nlandfill, wherever this is compatible with local con-\\nditions. Today, close to 40 percent of our 440 sites\\naround the world are already sending no waste to\\nlandfill.\\nTo support a culture of diversity and inclusion, in\\nline with our 2030 sustainability goal of promot-\\ning social progress, we launched a gender-neu-\\ntral parental leave program for all ABB employees\\naround the world. We also increased the proportion\\nof women in senior management to 16.3 percent,\\nfrom 13.5 percent in 2020. By 2030, our goal is that\\n25 percent of senior management roles are filled by\\nwomen.\\nTo ensure that sustainability is taken as seri-\\nously as our other performance targets, we are\\nintegrating sustainability KPIs into our perfor-\\nmance management planning and our businesses\\nare reporting them at the same time as financial\\nKPIs. Sustainability KPIs are now also part of se-\\nnior management incentives and a selection is in-\\ncluded in our quarterly financial reports.\\nFinally, to encourage our people to get personally\\ninvolved in driving ABB\\'s sustainability journey, we\\nlaunched the \"Sustainability Changemaker Award\",\\ninviting ideas that support the achievement of our\\n2030 sustainability goals. The winning individual\\nor team will get the chance to turn their idea into\\nreality.\\n### Strong future prospects\\nHaving decentralized our organization and success-\\nfully rolled out our ABB Way operating model, we\\nare in a strong position to capture future growth\\nopportunities. The three key growth drivers for our\\nbusinesses are: resource efficiency through electri-\\nfication and automation, where we are global lead-\\ners, occupying number 1 or 2 positions in the mar-\\nket; new ways of working, in which our Divisions\\nare accountable for growth and decision-making\\nhas been moved closer to the market; and the ac-\\nceleration of environmental, social and governance\\n(ESG) drivers for energy efficiency and automation.\\nAccordingly, we have lifted our revenue growth tar-\\nget to 4-7 percent through the economic cycle,\\nin constant currency. Of that, we expect 3-5 per-\\ncent to come from organic growth and 1-2 percent\\nfrom acquired growth. We have also sharpened\\nour operational EBITA margin target to be at least\\n15 percent as of 2023. Previously, we had targeted\\n3-5 percent for revenue growth through the cycle\\nand an operational EBITA margin in the upper half\\nof a 13-16 percent range as of 2023.\\nWith our leading technologies and talented people,\\nwe are confident that ABB will continue to go from\\nstrength to strength while living up to the expec-\\ntations of its stakeholders and making a valuable\\ncontribution to a more sustainable society.\\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors and the Ex-\\necutive Committee, we would like to thank our\\ncustomers and shareholders for their continued\\ntrust in ABB and to thank our employees for their\\ntremendous commitment, engagement and hard\\nwork. We are proud to lead them.\\nBest regards,\\nPesto und\\nPETER VOSER\\nChairman of the Board\\nof Directors\\nBJÖRN ROSENGREN\\nChief Executive Officer',\n",

       " '\\n\\n\\n—\\nKey investor questions 2021\\n===\\nQ\\nYou have moved to a decentralized\\noperating model during 2020 and 2021 -\\nThe ABB Way - is this now fully implemented?\\nA\\nWe have come a long way and have reached\\nimportant milestones. Under the ABB Way,\\nthe Divisions represent the highest level of op-\\nerating decisions ensuring speed and customer\\nfocused decisions as they are closest to the mar-\\nkets. A lean corporate only focuses on necessary\\nstrategic, financial and governance activities. The\\nDivisions are fully accountable for their perfor-\\nmance and the divisional targets are aligned with\\ntheir strategic mandate of stability, profitabil-\\nity before growth. To complement the decentral-\\nized operating model, we apply an improved per-\\nformance management system. This facilitates\\ntransparency on divisional and Business Area\\nperformance, based on a standardized set of Key\\nPerformance Indicators. To fully complete the de-\\ncentralized way of working at ABB, our focus area\\nin 2022 will be to make sure that we also have ac-\\ncountability, transparency and speed within all\\nof the Divisions. In many cases, it makes sense to\\ndrive global accountability even one level lower\\nfor product groups within Divisions and here we\\nstill have potential to improve.\\nQ\\nWhat are the levers to reach at least 15 per-\\ncent Operational EBITA margin in 2023?\\nA\\nWe have made strong progress towards our\\nprofitability target during 2021, improv-\\ning the Operational EBITA margin from 11.1% in\\n2020 to 14.2% in 2021. This was driven by bet-\\nter results in all Business Areas, supported by in-\\ncreased efficiency, good volumes and part of the\\ncost base still running at lower \"pandemic levels\",\\nas well as clearly lower corporate costs and lower\\nspecific items which impact comparability. We\\nsee further potential in all of our Business Areas.\\nSix out of 18 Divisions (excluding Divisions that\\nwe plan to exit) have a strategic mandate to sta-\\nbilize their business or improve profitability. The\\nremaining 12 Divisions are incentivized to drive\\nprofitable growth and therefore improve the mix\\nof the Group. All Divisions have an annual pro-\\nductivity target of 3 percent per annum and will\\nfocus on pushing through strategic pricing ac-\\ntions and further improve operational efficien-\\ncies including footprint optimizations. Addition-\\nally, the exit of our non-core business will also be\\nan important driver.',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\nQ\\nYou are now targeting 3 to 5 percent\\ncomparable growth through the cycle,\\nclearly above what you have achieved over the\\nlast five years. What has changed?\\nA\\nIn recent years, we have taken significant\\norganic and inorganic actions to align our\\nbusiness portfolio to more attractive growth\\nmarkets, increasing our focus on discrete indus-\\ntries as well as transport and infrastructure that\\noffer better growth opportunities. This ongoing\\nshift towards better quality of revenues is part\\nof ABB's DNA which centers around resource-\\nefficiency in electrification and automation. Ad-\\nditionally, the responsibility for growth has now\\nbeen fully transferred into the businesses, close\\nto customers. Divisions have the best insights\\ninto current and future customer needs and are\\naccountable to build their respective business\\naccordingly. With more Divisions transitioning\\nfrom stability and profitability to growth over\\ntime, we expect to see a continuous shift in the\\ngrowth profile of ABB. Finally, the underlying de-\\nmand for our products, systems and services is\\nsupported by the escalating drivers from sus-\\ntainability megatrends with more favorable regu-\\nlations, improved technology and changing con-\\nsumer patters.\\nQ\\nWhat is the timeline for the remaining port-\\nfolio actions after the divestment of the\\nMechanical Power Transmission Division?\\nA\\nActive portfolio management is part of our\\nperformance culture. On the back of sys-\\ntematic portfolio reviews we ascertain whether\\nultimately ABB is the best owner of the differ-\\nent businesses. As a result, we successfully di-\\nvested the Mechanical Power Transmission Divi-\\nsion during 2021. We continue to make progress\\non the exit of the Turbocharging Division, where\\nwe are currently running a dual track process for\\na spin-off or divestment with a spin-off currently\\nlooking more likely and a preliminary timeline for\\nsummer 2022. We plan to exit the Power Conver-\\nsion Division during H2 2022 upon improving per-\\nformance. In addition, we target to complete the\\nlegal separation of the E-mobility Division during\\nQ1 2022 and work towards an IPO in Q2 2022 to\\ncreate a platform for accelerated growth and\\nvalue creation. We plan to remain a clear majority\\nowner of the new company. At the same time, our\\nactive portfolio management process is driving\\ndecisions within the Divisions to improve or exit\\nareas of underperformance, supporting improved\\nperformance ambitions. Further, the Group in-\\ntends to pursue strategic partnerships as well as\\nbolt-on acquisitions driven by the Divisions. Over\\ntime it is our ambition to complete approximately\\nfive bolt-on acquisitions each year.\\nYou ended the year 2021 with a net cash\\nposition and have significantly improved\\nyour cash generation. What are your capital\\nallocation priorities?\\nA\\nWe reiterate our capital allocation principles,\\nwhich are 1) funding organic growth, 2) pay-\\ning a rising, sustainable dividend per share over\\ntime, 3) investing in value creating acquisitions\\nand 4) returning additional cash to shareholders,\\nwhich we have mainly done through buybacks in\\nthe past. We expect that our improved cash gen-\\neration on the back of the ABB Way operating\\nmodel will enhance our flexibility to invest in both\\norganic growth and bolt-on acquisitions, while\\nproviding attractive returns to shareholders. We\\naim to increase the pace of acquisitions going for-\\nward, adding technology, digital know-how and\\nfurther improve geographical footprint. Addition-\\nally, we plan to continue our share buybacks for\\nfull year of 2022, also in excess of the PG capital\\nreturn program.\\n## C\\nHow are you managing the various supply\\nchain imbalances that you are currently\\nfacing?\\nA\\nUnder the ABB Way, the Divisions are in the\\nlead to manage the supply chain imbalances.\\nMitigating measures include Divisions cooperat-\\ning where it is an advantage to pool supply vol-\\numes and put the combined ABB weight behind\\nsupply chain negotiations, including C-suite dis-\\ncussions where needed. Disruptions towards the\\nend of the year were tangible, predominantly in\\nsemiconductor shortages but also in logistics.\\n## Q\\nWhat are your expectations for ABB in\\n2022?\\nA\\nIn full year 2022, we expect a steady mar-\\ngin improvement towards the 2023 target of\\nat least 15%, supported by increased efficiency\\nas we fully incorporate the decentralized operat-\\ning model and performance culture in all our di-\\nvisions. Furthermore, we expect support from an\\nanticipated positive market momentum and our\\nstrong order backlog.\",\n",

Strong demand\\nboosted our order and revenue growth, but\\nsupply-chain disruptions caused delays in deliver-\\nies to customers in the second half of the year.\\nOverall, we are pleased with ABB\\'s financial\\nperformance, which has improved significantly\\ncompared with pre-pandemic times.\\nAgainst that backdrop, we continued to transform\\nABB by moving accountability to our Divisions,\\nincreasing efficiency, making our operations safer\\nand more sustainable, and redesigning our leader-\\nship development and succession planning. We\\nalso plan to spin off our Turbocharging Division\\nand separately list our E-mobility business. With\\nthese steps, we are living up to our Purpose of\\ncreating superior, sustainable value, and strength-\\nening our focus on electrification and automation,\\nboth of which are key technologies to reduce\\nemissions and enable a more sustainable future.\\n### Sustainability strategy 2030\\nIn 2021, we began implementing our 2030 sustain-\\nability strategy, with the focus on reducing\\nCO2-equivalent emissions across our value chain.\\nIn the past two years, we have reduced emissions\\nfrom our own operations by 39 percent, putting\\nus well on track to achieve our goal of carbon\\nneutrality by 2030. In the years ahead, we can\\nmake an even bigger contribution in our custom-\\ners\\' operations through many of our technologies\\nlike ABB\\'s energy-efficient electric motors and\\ndrives and electric-vehicle charging solutions. By\\n2030, we aim to help our customers reduce their\\nannual CO2-equivalent emissions by 100 mega-\\ntons, equivalent to the annual emissions of 30\\nmillion combustion cars.\\nWe also clarified roles and responsibilities related\\nto sustainability within the Board: The Gover-\\nnance and Nomination Committee is responsible\\nfor overseeing corporate social responsibility\\n(including health, safety and environment as well\\nas sustainability), while ultimate responsibility for\\nABB\\'s sustainability strategy, its sustainability\\ntargets and its annual sustainability report lies\\nwith the entire Board of Directors.\\nAt next year\\'s AGM, we intend to seek shareholder\\nsupport for our environmental, social and gover-\\nnance (ESG) goals. These include emissions\\nreductions across our value chain, increasing\\ncircularity in our own and our customers\\' opera-\\ntions, and promoting social progress, including\\nhuman rights and good governance, in our supply\\nchain and the communities in which we operate.\\n### Stock-exchange listings\\nIn December, we appointed a new head of our\\nTurbocharging Division ahead of a likely spin-off,\\nin the event of which we would invite shareholders\\nto an extraordinary general meeting to seek their\\napproval. We are also moving ahead with efforts\\nto separately list our E-mobility business and we\\naim to complete this during the second quarter.\\nABB would retain a majority shareholding in the\\nfuture listed entity. As a world leader in electric-\\nvehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, we are\\nwell-positioned in an extremely attractive growth\\nmarket - by 2035, EVs are expected to be outsell-\\ning combustion cars.\\n#### Board assessment and diversity\\nIn 2021, an external assessment concluded that\\nthe Board\\'s effectiveness was in the top quartile\\nof comparable companies. The assessment put\\nforward a small number of recommendations\\nconcerning the Board\\'s role in ESG, risk and\\nreputation management, and future requirements\\nin the skills matrix of new Board members, all of\\nwhich were comprehensively addressed by the\\nBoard during the course of last year. As part of\\nthis assessment, we also conducted a peer review\\nwithin the Board in which every Board member\\nassessed the individual performance of all other\\nmembers. The Board will continue to conduct\\ninternal self-assessments every year, comple-\\nmented periodically with external reviews.\\nLast year, we also highlighted the need to improve\\ngender diversity on the Board of Directors. In\\n2021, we sought and identified candidates that\\nwould further strengthen the Board\\'s diversity,\\nexpertise and experience.

Instead\\nof position-based succession planning, we have\\nintroduced an open job market, where all posi-\\ntions up to Executive Committee (EC) level are\\nposted on our internal jobs platform.

       " \"\\n\\n\\n## Business relationships between\\nABB and its Board members\\nThis section describes important business rela-\\ntionships between ABB and its Board members,\\nor companies and organizations represented by\\nthem.\\nFluor Corporation (Fluor) is an important cus-\\ntomer of ABB. ABB sells primarily electrical\\nswitchgears, control systems and electrical\\nsolutions through its Electrification and Process\\nAutomation businesses to Fluor. David Constable\\nis the CEO and a director of Fluor.\\nAfter reviewing the level of business with Fluor,\\nthe Board has determined that ABB's business\\nrelationship with Fluor is not unusual in its nature\\nor conditions and does not constitute a material\\nbusiness relationship. As a result, the Board\\nconcluded that all members of the Board are\\nindependent.\\nThese determinations were made in accordance\\nwith ABB Ltd's Related Party Transaction Policy\\nwhich was prepared based on the Swiss Code of\\nBest Practice for Corporate Governance and the\\nindependence criteria set forth in the corporate\\ngovernance rules of the New York Stock Exchange.\\nThis policy is contained in the ABB Ltd Board\\nGovernance Rules (available at https://new.abb.\\ncom/about/corporate-governance).\\n## Information and control systems\\nof the Board vis-à-vis the\\nExecutive Committee\\nInformation from the Executive Committee\\nIn accordance with the ABB Board Governance\\nRules (available at https://new.abb.com/about/\\ncorporate-governance), the CEO reports regularly\\nto the Board about ABB's overall business and\\nwhen circumstances require on any extraordinary\\nevents that may arise. This includes:\\n· Reports on financial results (including profit\\nand loss, balance sheet and cash flows);\\n· Changes in key members of management;\\n. Information that may affect the supervisory or\\nmonitoring function of the Board (including on\\nmatters of strategy and compliance); and\\n· Significant developments in legal matters.\\nAt each Board meeting, Board members are\\nbriefed by the Chairman, CEO, CFO and other EC\\nmembers on ABB's business performance and on\\nmaterial developments affecting ABB. Outside of\\nBoard meetings, Board members generally chan-\\nnel any requests for information through the\\nChairman. Board members also obtain informa-\\ntion through offsite retreats with the Executive\\nCommittee and visits to ABB sites. In addition,\\nBoard members obtain information through the\\nBoard committees in which they participate and\\nwhich are also attended by relevant EC members\\nand management representatives from human\\nresources, finance, legal and the business.\\n### Internal Audit\\nABB has an Internal Audit team that provides\\nindependent objective assurance and other\\nservices to help ensure that ABB operates in\\naccordance with applicable laws as well as inter-\\nnal policies and procedures. Internal Audit reports\\nto the FACC and to the CFO. The FACC reviews and\\napproves the internal audit plan, and material\\nchanges to the plan. Investigations of potential\\nfraud and inappropriate business conduct are an\\nintegral part of the internal audit process. De-\\npending on circumstances, Internal Audit may act\\ntogether with ABB's Integrity Investigations and\\nMonitoring department, which is part of ABB's\\nintegrity function. Internal Audit reports on a\\nregular basis its main observations and recom-\\nmendations to the relevant members of the EC\\nand to the FACC as appropriate.\\n### Risk Management\\nABB has an enterprise risk management program\\n(ERM) in place which takes into account ABB's size\\nand complexity. ERM provides the EC and the\\nBoard with a comprehensive and holistic view of\\nthe risks facing the business. ERM involves man-\\naging the acceptance of risk to achieve the\\nobjectives of the business. The ERM process is\\ntypically cyclical in nature, conveying the idea of\\ncontinuous refinement of the risk management\\napproach in a dynamic business environment.\\nFurthermore, ABB runs a mitigation process for\\nthe identified risks that is key to the success of\\nthis process. ERM assessments are both top down\\nand bottom up. They cover strategic, financial,\\nand operational risks, both current and long term.\\nKey risks identified and managed in 2021 were\\nthose related to the continuation of the COVID-19\\npandemic, to constraints in global supply chains,\\nas well as to the preparation for the separation of\\nABB's turbocharging business and the planned\\ninitial public offering in Switzerland of ABB's\\nelectric-vehicle charging business. ERM results\\nare reported to the FACC and the entire Board.\\nThis information becomes part of the overall\\nstrategic and risk discussions by the Board to\\nhelp create value for stakeholders.\",\n",

Except for the cases de-\\nscribed under \"Limitations on transferability of\\nshares and nominee registration\" below, there are\\nno voting rights restrictions limiting ABB\\'s share-\\nholders\\' rights.\\n#### Annual General Meeting/COVID-19\\nABB\\'s top priority is protecting the health of its\\nshareholders and employees. Therefore, due to\\nthe extraordinary circumstances and in accor-\\ndance with applicable Swiss COVID-19 legislation,\\nshareholders were not able to attend ABB\\'s\\nAnnual General Meeting 2021 in person, but could\\nexercise their shareholder rights via the indepen-\\ndent proxy only.

Any such request must be\\nmade in writing at least 40 days prior to the date\\nof the general meeting and specify the items and\\nthe motions of such shareholder(s).\\nABB's Articles of Incorporation do not contain\\nprovisions on the convocation of the general\\nmeeting of shareholders that differ from the\\napplicable legal provisions.\\n### Shareholders' dividend rights\\nThe unconsolidated statutory financial state-\\nments of ABB Ltd are prepared in accordance with\\nSwiss law. Based on these financial statements,\\ndividends may be paid only if ABB Ltd has suffi-\\ncient distributable profits from previous years or\\nsufficient free reserves to allow the distribution\\nof a dividend. Swiss law requires that ABB Ltd\\nretain at least 5 percent of its annual net profits\\nas legal reserves until these reserves amount to at\\nleast 20 percent of ABB Ltd's share capital. Any\\nnet profits remaining in excess of those reserves\\nare at the disposal of the shareholders' meeting.\\nUnder Swiss law, ABB Ltd may only pay out a\\ndividend if it has been proposed by a shareholder\\nor the Board of Directors and approved at a\\ngeneral meeting of shareholders, and the auditors\\nconfirm that the dividend conforms to statutory\\nlaw and ABB's Articles of Incorporation. In prac-\\ntice, the shareholders' meeting usually approves\\ndividends as proposed by the Board of Directors.\\nDividends are usually due and payable no earlier\\nthan 2 trading days after the shareholders' resolu-\\ntion and the ex-date for dividends is normally 2\\ntrading days after the shareholders' resolution\\napproving the dividend. Dividends are paid out to\\nthe holders that are registered on the record date.\\nEuroclear administers the payment of those shares\\nregistered with it. Under Swiss law, dividends not\\ncollected within 5 years after the due date accrue\\nto ABB Ltd and are allocated to its other reserves.\\nAs ABB Ltd pays cash dividends, if any, in Swiss\\nfrancs (subject to the exception for certain share-\\nholders in Sweden described below), exchange\\nrate fluctuations will affect the U.S. dollar\\namounts received by holders of ADSs upon conver-\\nsion of those cash dividends by Citibank, N.A., the\\ndepositary, in accordance with the Amended and\\nRestated Deposit Agreement dated May 7, 2001.\\nFor shareholders who are residents of Sweden,\\nABB has established a dividend access facility (for\\nup to 600,004,716 shares). With respect to any\\nannual dividend payment for which this facility is\\nmade available, shareholders who register with\\nEuroclear may elect to receive the dividend from\\nABB Norden Holding AB in Swedish krona (in an\\namount equivalent to the dividend paid in Swiss\\nfrancs) without deduction of Swiss withholding\\ntax. For further information on the dividend\\naccess facility, see ABB's Articles of Incorporation.\\n### Limitations on transferability of shares and\\nnominee registration\\nABB may decline a registration with voting rights\\nif a shareholder does not declare that it has\\nacquired the shares in its own name and for its\\nown account. If the shareholder refuses to make\\nsuch declaration, it will be registered as a share-\\nholder without voting rights. A person failing to\\nexpressly declare in its registration/application\\nthat it holds the shares for its own account (a\\nnominee), will be entered in the share register\\nwith voting rights, provided that such nominee\\nhas entered into an agreement with ABB concern-\\ning its status, and further provided that the\\nnominee is subject to recognized bank or financial\\nmarket supervision. In special cases the Board\\nmay grant exemptions. There were no exemptions\\ngranted in 2021. The limitation on the transfer-\\nability of shares may be removed by an\\namendment of ABB's Articles of Incorporation\\nby a shareholders' resolution requiring two-thirds\\nof the votes represented at the meeting.\\n### No restriction on trading of shares\\nNo restrictions are imposed on the transferability\\nof ABB shares. The registration of shareholders in\\nthe ABB share register, Euroclear and the ADS\\nregister kept by Citibank does not affect transfer-\\nability of ABB shares or ADSs. Registered ABB\\nshareholders or ADR holders may therefore pur-\\nchase or sell their ABB shares or ADRs at any time,\\nincluding before a General Meeting regardless of\\nthe record date. The record date serves only to\\ndetermine the right to vote at a General Meeting.\\n#### Duty to make a public tender offer\\nABB's Articles of Incorporation do not contain any\\nprovisions raising the threshold (opting up) or\\nwaiving the duty (opting out) to make a public\\ntender offer pursuant to Article 135 of the Swiss\\nAct on Financial Market Infrastructures and\\nMarket Conduct in Securities and Derivatives\\nTrading.\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n\\n—\\nLetter from the Chairman of the\\nCompensation Committee\\n===\\n## Dear Shareholders,\\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors and the\\nCompensation Committee, I am pleased to pres-\\nent the ABB Compensation Report for 2021.\\nOur focus remains to ensure that the compensa-\\ntion structure at ABB drives value creation for our\\nshareholders, represents a motivating package\\nfor our executives, meets best-practice corporate\\ngovernance standards and aligns with ABB\\'s\\nsustainability strategy.\\n## Summary of changes for 2022\\nOne of the main subjects of our analysis this year\\nwas how to best link our sustainability strategy\\n- and its associated ambitious targets for 2030\\n- to the short- and long-term incentive plans of\\nour Executive Committee (EC) members. This and\\nother discussions resulted in a suite of changes\\nwhich we believe will place ABB in line with leading\\nmarket practices for executive compensation and\\nreinforce our commitment towards sustainability\\nand long-term value creation. In brief:\\nAnnual Incentive Plan (AIP)\\nAll EC members will have two or more KPIs relat-\\ning to environmental, social and corporate\\ngovernance (ESG) matters in the personal compo-\\nnent of their short-term incentive plan, and the\\nexisting mechanism of subjectively adjusting its\\noutcome against an ESG \"boundary condition\"\\nwill be discontinued.\\nLong-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\\n. A Corporate ESG measure will be added to the\\nLTIP of all EC members, with a material\\nweighting of 20 percent, and the Company\\nwill set and prospectively disclose appropriate\\nESG target(s) on an annual basis. The target\\nfor the 2022 LTIP is set out in this\\nCompensation Report;\\n. There will be no vesting of the Total Shareholder\\nReturn (TSR) portion of our LTIP award below\\nthe median (50th percentile) of the peer group;\\n· A dividend equivalent (to the dividends paid\\nduring the vesting period) payment will be\\nintroduced on the final number of awarded\\nshares at the time of vesting. This will be largely\\noffset by the reduction of other\\nbenefit-related costs;\\n· The existing discretion to increase or decrease\\nthe target pool size applicable to EC members\\nwill be discontinued, as well as the discretion to\\nincrease or decrease individual target grants\\n(except to give no grant in certain\\ncircumstances) and\\n. The clawback and leaver provisions will be\\nupdated to provide greater clarity of the use of\\ndiscretion of the Compensation Committee to\\nadjust the formulaic outcomes of the\\nachievement level against defined performance\\nmeasures and targets.\\nPolicy and general terms and conditions\\nNew joiners to the EC will have an increased\\nvariable, performance oriented portion of com-\\npensation mix and, in turn, a reduced fixed\\nportion, when compared to current EC members.\\nThe compensation structure for the EC, its pur-\\npose and links to our Company strategy, and\\nassociated performance measures, valid as of\\n2022, are set out in Exhibit 3 below.\\n## Compensation policy outcomes\\nBoard of Directors: the approved maximum\\naggregate compensation for the 2021-2022 term\\nis lower than for the previous term, as a result\\nof a reduction in the number of members of the\\nBoard (from eleven to ten).\\nThe aggregate Board compensation for the\\n2021-2022 term is in line with the amount\\napproved at the 2021 Annual General Meeting\\n(AGM). There has been no change to the individual\\nBoard fees since 2015 .\\nExecutive Committee: the aggregate EC total\\ncompensation was CHF 39.2 million in 2021,\\ncompared to CHF 35.4 million in 2020, as summa-\\nrized in Exhibit 21 below and presented in detail in\\nExhibits 38 and 39. This difference in total com-\\npensation was driven by the increase in\\nperformance related variable pay elements.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nThree of the nine EC members in place in March\\n2021 received a salary adjustment, which ranged\\nfrom 2.1 to 6.7 percent, for exceptional perfor-\\nmance and/or market adjustment. This\\ncorresponded to an average 1.3 percent increase\\non annual aggregate base salaries for the EC\\nmembers in post in March 2021, which was\\nbroadly consistent with the salary review budget\\nfor the wider Swiss employee population.\\nThe average award for the current EC members\\nunder the AIP for 2021 was 143.4 percent (out\\nof a maximum 150 percent), compared to\\n72.4 percent in 2020. This significant outcome\\nwas driven by a strong performance from all\\nbusinesses, leading to an overachievement re-\\nlated to the majority of the 2021 AIP financial\\ntargets. In comparison, the 2020 performance\\nlevels were heavily influenced by the impact on\\nthe business from the COVID-19 pandemic, and no\\nchanges in targets were made.\\nThe average weighted achievement level of the\\n2018 LTIP, which vested in 2021, was 57.4 percent\\n(out of a maximum 200 percent). There was no\\nvesting under the EPS component, which was\\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that took\\nplace during the performance period, and for\\nwhich no adjustments to targets were applied.\\n## Disclosure\\nDuring the reporting year, the Compensation\\nCommittee listened carefully to inputs and sug-\\ngestions to increase the clarity of disclosures in\\nour Compensation Reports. As such, we intro-\\nduced a new section \"Compensation at a glance\"\\nat the beginning of the Compensation Report,\\nwhere we provide a tabular overview of the EC\\ncompensation structure. We continue to structure\\nthe Compensation Report to clearly differentiate\\nbetween our compensation policies and their\\nimplementation. It is also intended to progres-\\nsively move from narrative and complex tables\\ntowards more simplified charts with enhanced\\ndisclosures.\\n## Governance\\nDuring 2021, the CC also reviewed the Company\\'s\\ngender pay policy and disclosure requirements\\nand fully performed its regular activities, which\\ninclude formulating the Compensation Report,\\npreparing the \"say-on-pay\" vote for the AGM,\\nreviewing the terms of departure for members of\\nthe EC, and recommending to the Board the\\nperformance measures and targets for the EC as\\nwell as the compensation of the Board, the CEO\\nand the EC members. You will find further infor-\\nmation on our activities and on ABB\\'s\\ncompensation system and governance in the\\nfollowing pages.\\nAt the AGM on March 24, 2022, you will be asked to\\nvote on the maximum aggregate compensation\\nfor the Board for its 2022-2023 term and on the\\nmaximum aggregate compensation for the EC in\\n2023. It is important to note that the increase in\\nmaximum aggregate compensation for 2023,\\nrather than any structural increase to EC compen-\\nsation, is the result of the associated cost related\\nto the 2020 LTIP vesting in 2023, influenced by the\\nincreased number of shares subject to vesting\\ncompared to prior years; the current, solid perfor-\\nmance of the Company against its earnings per\\nshare targets and total shareholder return peer\\ngroup; and the strong share price development\\nsince the time of grant, with a reference price of\\nCHF 19.36.\\nThis Compensation Report will also be submitted\\nfor a non-binding, consultative vote by\\nshareholders.\\nWe encourage and pursue an open and regular\\ndialogue with all of our stakeholders. Your con-\\nstructive input is highly valued and appreciated as\\nwe continue to improve our compensation\\nsystem. On behalf of the Compensation Commit-\\ntee, I thank you for your continued trust in ABB\\nand for your consistently supportive feedback.\\nFrederico Fleury Curado\\nChairman of the Compensation Committee\\nZurich, February 24, 2022',\n",

The CEO, the Chief Human Resources\\nOfficer (CHRO) and the Head of Performance and\\nReward also attend all or part of the CC meetings\\nin an advisory capacity. The Chairman of the CC\\nmay decide to invite other executives upon con-\\nsultation with the CEO, as appropriate. Executives\\ndo not attend the meetings or the parts of the\\nmeetings in which their own compensation and/\\nor performance are being discussed. Details on\\nmeeting attendance of the individual CC mem-\\nbers (number of meetings held during 2021, their\\naverage duration, as well as the attendance of the\\nindividual members) are provided in the section\\ntitled \"Board of Directors - Meetings and atten-\\ndance\" of the Corporate Governance Report.\\nThe Chairman of the CC reports to the full Board\\nafter each CC meeting. The minutes of the meet-\\nings are available to the members of the Board.\\nThe CC retains independent, external advisors for\\ncompensation matters.

This mindset is\\nsupported by our Diversity & Inclusion Strategy\\n2030, that clearly defines ABB plans to ensure an\\ninclusive culture and equal treatment of everyone,\\nregardless of gender, age, ethnic origin, sexual\\norientation, etc. Equal pay is a critical component\\nof this strategy.\\nIn Switzerland, under the revised Swiss Federal\\nAct on Gender Equality (GEA) that came into force\\nlast year, legal entities with more than 100 em-\\nployees are required to conduct an equal pay\\nanalysis. ABB has completed this analysis for all\\nfour required legal entities and the results of this\\nanalysis were verified by an external accounting\\nfirm, KPMG. As a result, the two in-scope legal\\nentities forming part of ABB Switzerland (ABB\\nSchweiz AG and ABB Power Protection SA, which\\nnow is part of ABB Schweiz AG), meet the equal\\npay requirements and are within the applicable\\nthresholds for salary and overall compensation\\n(salary plus actual bonus).\\nAt ABB Headquarters, ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd\\nmeets the equal pay requirements and is within\\nthe applicable thresholds for salary and overall\\ncompensation (salary plus actual bonus). The\\nsmaller legal entity in scope, ABB Management\\nServices Ltd, meets the equal pay requirements\\nfor salary and slightly underachieves the parity\\nlevel for overall compensation (salary plus actual\\nbonus), as it has employees from different busi-\\nnesses assigned with different bonus plans,\\nleading to varying levels of bonus payments. In\\naccordance with the Swiss law, ABB will continue\\nto monitor these requirements.\\n## Board compensation policy\\nThe compensation policy for the members of the\\nBoard is designed to attract and retain experi-\\nenced people to the Board of Directors.\\nCompensation takes into account the responsibil-\\nities, time and effort required to fulfill their roles\\non the Board and its Committees, and is generally\\npositioned at levels similar to other Swiss listed\\ncompanies of comparable size and complexity.\\n### Compensation structure\\nA fixed fee is payable for the Chairman,\\nVice-Chairman and members of the Board, and\\nadditional fees are payable for chairing or mem-\\nbership of a Board Committee, except for the\\nChairman and Vice-Chairman. Board members are\\npaid for their service over a 12-month period that\\nstarts with their election at the AGM. Payment of\\nfees is made in semi-annual installments in\\narrears.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nEach fee is delivered in cash and shares, although\\nBoard members may elect to receive all their fees\\nin shares. The number of shares delivered is\\ncalculated prior to each semi-annual payment by\\ndividing the monetary amount to which the Board\\nmembers are entitled by the average closing price\\nof the ABB share over a predefined 30-day period.\\nThe shares are subject to a three-year restriction\\nperiod during which they cannot be sold, trans-\\nferred or pledged. Any restricted shares are\\nunblocked when the Board member leaves\\nthe Board.\\n## Implementation of Board\\ncompensation policy\\n### Board fees by role\\nAs mentioned above, the levels and mix of com-\\npensation of Board members are regularly\\ncompared against the compensation of\\nnon-executive Board members from a cross-\\nsection of publicly traded companies in Switzer-\\nland that are part of the Swiss Market Index (i.e.,\\nAdecco, Alcon, Geberit, Givaudan, Holcim, Lonza,\\nRichemont, SGS, Sika, Swisscom, Swiss Life,\\nZurich Insurance).

The Board compensation\\npaid for the previous 2020-2021 term of office\\nwas below the amount approved by the share-\\nholders due to the voluntary donation of\\n10 percent of fees for a six-month period during\\n2020 to fight the impacts of the COVID-19\\npandemic.\\nExhibit 13: Board compensation (in CHF)\\nBoard of Directors\\nBoard term\\n2021-2022\\n2020-2021\\nNumber of members\\n10\\n11\\nTotal compensation\\n4,380,000\\n4,436,500\\nMaximum aggregate\\ncompensation amount\\napproved at previous AGM\\n4,400,000\\n4,700,000\\n## Compensation of former Board members\\nIn 2021, no payment was made to any former\\nBoard member.\\n## Compensation for services rendered\\nIn 2021, ABB did not pay any fees or compensation\\nto the members of the Board for services ren-\\ndered to ABB other than those disclosed in this\\nCompensation Report.\\n## Shareholding of Board members\\nThe members of the Board collectively owned less\\nthan 1 percent of ABB\\'s total shares outstanding\\nat December 31, 2021.\\nExhibit 37 in the section \"Compensation tables\\nand share ownership tables\" shows the number of\\nABB shares held by each Board member at Decem-\\nber 31, 2021 and 2020.

For all except the individual mea-\\nsure, a minimum level of performance, below\\nwhich there is no award (threshold) and a maxi-\\nmum level of performance, above which the award\\nis capped at 150 percent of the target (cap), will\\nalso be defined.

Under this approach, the Board agreed to\\nreview whether the Company had made sufficient\\nprogress at the end of the year to justify making\\nthe indicated AIP award. If, in the opinion of the\\nBoard, insufficient progress had been made, the\\nAIP award might have been reduced on a discre-\\ntionary basis. Following feedback from\\nstakeholders, this practice will be discontinued in\\n2022 and replaced with the approach to ESG in the\\nAIP individual measure described above, and in\\nthe LTIP described below.\\nVariable compensation - Long-Term Incentive\\nPlan (LTIP)\\n###### Purpose and link to strategy\\nRewards the achievement of predefined perfor-\\nmance goals over a three year period.

The TSR calculations are made for the reference\\nperiod beginning in the year of the conditional\\ngrant of the shares and ending three years later.\\nThe evaluation is performed by an independent\\nthird party.\\n. For grants from 2022, the award curve for the\\nTSR measure will be adjusted to become more\\nchallenging. The threshold point for awards, for\\nwhich vesting starts, will move from the 25th\\npercentile to the 50th percentile (P50) of the\\nTSR peer group, i.e., there will be no award for\\nperformance below P50.\\n· Vesting for P50 achievement remains at\\n100 percent of target, and vesting for a 75th\\npercentile (P75) achievement level remains at\\n200 percent of target (capped).

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\nHistory of the ABB Group\\n===\\nThe ABB Group was formed in 1988\\nthrough a merger between Asea AB and BBC\\nBrown Boveri AG. Initially founded in 1883, Asea\\nAB was a major participant in the introduction of\\nelectricity into Swedish homes and businesses\\nand in the development of Sweden's railway\\nnetwork. In the 1940s and 1950s, Asea AB ex-\\npanded into the power, mining and steel\\nindustries. Brown Boveri and Cie. (later renamed\\nBBC Brown Boveri AG) was formed in Switzerland\\nin 1891 and initially specialized in power genera-\\ntion and turbines. In the early to mid-1900s, it\\nexpanded its operations throughout Europe and\\nbroadened its business operations to in-\\nclude a wide range of electrical engineering\\nactivities.\\nIn January 1988, Asea AB and BBC Brown Boveri\\nAG each contributed almost all of their businesses\\nto the newly formed ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd,\\nof which they each owned 50 percent. In 1996,\\nAsea AB was renamed ABB AB and BBC Brown\\nBoveri AG was renamed ABB AG. In February 1999,\\nthe ABB Group announced a group reconfigura-\\ntion designed to establish a single parent holding\\ncompany and a single class of shares. ABB Ltd was\\nincorporated on March 5, 1999, under the laws of\\nSwitzerland. In June 1999, ABB Ltd became the\\nholding company for the entire ABB Group. This\\nwas accomplished by having ABB Ltd issue shares\\nto the shareholders of ABB AG and ABB AB, the\\ntwo companies that formerly owned the ABB\\nGroup. The ABB Ltd shares were exchanged for\\nthe shares of those two companies, which,\\nas a result of the share exchange and certain\\nrelated transactions, became wholly-owned\\nsubsidiaries of ABB Ltd.\\nAs described above, on July 1, 2020, we divested\\n80.1 percent of our ownership in the Power Grids\\nbusiness to Hitachi.\\nABB Ltd shares are currently listed on the SIX\\nSwiss Exchange, the NASDAQ OMX Stockholm\\nExchange and the New York Stock Exchange (in\\nthe form of American Depositary Shares).\\n—\\n## ABB Today\\nAs a global leader in resource efficiency, excelling\\nin electrification and automation, our offering is\\nrelevant for the global energy transition,\\nincreased energy efficiency, and the transition to\\nmore adaptive manufacturing and automation,\\nputting us right in the center of long-term secu-\\nlar trends.\\n## The ABB Purpose\\nThe ABB Purpose captures what we do, and the\\nABB Way describes how we do it. With our Pur-\\npose at the core, ABB strives to create superior\\nvalue for customers, employees and shareholders.\\nThe ABB Purpose is summarized as:\\n· We succeed by creating superior value.\\n. We push the boundaries of technology to drive\\nperformance to new levels.\\n· We energize the transformation of society and\\nindustry to achieve a more productive,\\nsustainable future.\\n### Our core competencies\\nOur leadership in resource efficiency is based on\\nour core competencies, each of which\\nconstitutes a barrier to entry: decades-long\\ndomain expertise, cutting-edge technology and\\ninnovation as well as the ability to scale opera-\\ntions and distribution.\\nWith its long history, ABB not only invented or\\npioneered many power and automation technolo-\\ngies but has retained technology and market\\nleadership in many of these areas. Being present\\nin various vertical markets for decades with close\\nlong-term relationships with customers and\\nchannel partners has resulted in our unique deep\\ndomain expertise, enabling a thorough under-\\nstanding of customers' needs and operations.\\nWe continuously evolve our offering to\\nremain a relevant and trusted partner to our\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\ncustomers. Our annual non-order related research\\nand development spending in 2021 amounted to\\napproximately 4.2 percent of revenues. We focus\\nour research and development expenditures on\\nkey areas of innovation and have spent approxi-\\nmately $7 billion since the beginning of 2016,\\nfocusing on developing best-in-class products\\nand services in the fields of electrification and\\nautomation with the goal of helping our custom-\\ners to increased productivity and lower their\\necological footprint.\\n## The ABB Way\\nThe ABB Way is the glue that unites our Group and\\ncomprises a select number of common processes\\ncovering our business model, our people and\\nculture, the ABB brand and our governance frame-\\nwork. It facilitates accountability, transparency\\nand speed in ABB.\\nIn our operating model, the Divisions represent\\nthe highest level of operating decisions. They are\\nclosest to their respective markets and customer\\nneeds. Each Division progresses through the\\nstrategic mandates and priorities of stability and\\nprofitability before growth. Meaning, in order to\\ndeploy full focus on organic and acquired growth\\nto the extent of consolidating the market, the\\nbusiness' structure should be robust and profit-\\nability should be at least in line with industry\\npeers. We have made good progress on the transi-\\ntion through these priorities with two thirds of\\nour Divisions, representing approximately 60 per-\\ncent of Group revenues, now on a growth\\nmandate.\\nEach Division has full accountability for its results\\nand carries the responsibility for business devel-\\nopment, and research and development for\\nleading technology to secure a number 1 or 2\\nmarket position. To fully complete the decentral-\\nized way of working at ABB, our focus area in 2022\\nwill be to make sure that we also have account-\\nability, transparency and speed within all of the\\nDivisions. Strong performance management is\\nkey in a decentralized business model. We\\napply a monthly scorecard system for the Divi-\\nsions and Business Areas, based\\non a standardized set of Key Performance Indica-\\ntors, to support full transparency of performance.\\nIt is accompanied by a mandatory target to make\\nannual productivity improvements of at least\\n3 percent each year.\\nThe corporate functions focus on necessary\\nstrategic, financial and governance activities,\\nwith a lean headcount of approximately\\n800 employees.\\nAll our four Business Areas are market leaders in\\ntheir respective areas being in either the number 1\\nor 2 positions. Our global reach along with our\\nextensive local presence assists us in scaling\\ninnovations to achieve stronger returns, which\\nsupports higher absolute investments for future\\ngrowth. Active globally, our revenues are\\nwell-balanced across regions with customers\\nserved directly and through a strong channel\\npartner network.\\n### Enhanced growth profile\\nOver the past several years, we have taken signifi-\\ncant organic and inorganic actions to align our\\nbusiness portfolio to more attractive growth\\nmarkets, increasing our focus on discrete indus-\\ntries, as well as transport and infrastructure, that\\noffer better growth opportunities. Additionally,\\nwe have increased the proportion of sales stem-\\nming from short-cycle businesses,\\nmeaning a reduced proportion from\\nproject-related activities, which should reduce the\\nrisk and volatility in our earnings. This ongoing\\nshift towards better quality of revenues is part of\\nABB's DNA which centers around\\nresource-efficiency in electrification and\\nautomation.\\nThe responsibility for growth has been fully\\ntransferred to the Divisions, as they are closest to\\ncustomers. This includes both organic and ac-\\nquired growth. The Divisions have the best\\ninsights into current and future customer needs\\nand are accountable for building their respective\\nbusiness accordingly. With more Divisions transi-\\ntioning over time from stability and profitability\\nto growth, we expect to see a continuous shift in\\nour growth profile.\\nFinally, the underlying demand for our products,\\nsystems and services is supported by strong\\nsustainability megatrends with more favorable\\nregulations, improved technology and changing\\nconsumer patterns all being positive drivers. An\\nexample of such a megatrend is sustainable\\ntransport. We estimate that approximately 10 per-\\ncent of our order intake comes from this area and\\nthat we have outgrown the market in recent years.\\nThe related segments have different commercial\\nmaturity, including more mature technologies\\nwhich already generate significant orders, includ-\\ning traction systems in rail or hybrid ships using\\nAzipod® propulsion. Segments that are in com-\\nmercial take-off (i.e. currently see very high\\ngrowth rates) include electric vehicle charging\\nsolutions or robotic solutions for electric vehicle\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nmanufacturing. There are also very early-stage\\nsegments which are still emerging and which\\nmight offer a high potential in the future such as\\nfully electric mines (\"eMines\") or alternative fuels\\nsuch as hydrogen.\\n—\\nOur markets\\n===\\nABB is a leading global technology company\\nwith a comprehensive and increasingly digitalized\\noffering of electrification, motion and automa-\\ntion solutions. Our exposure to customers is\\ngeographically balanced while catering to multi-\\nple end-markets and segments. We believe that\\nour portfolio is well positioned to benefit from\\nsecular growth drivers, including urbanization,\\nlabor shortage, shift to electrification, automa-\\ntion and robotization, as well as other data and\\ndigitalization trends.\\nWe are focused on creating superior customer\\nvalue through our comprehensive, modular offer-\\ning, combining traditional products and services\\nwith software-enabled products and systems as\\nwell as digital services and software that we sell\\nboth separately and combined as scalable solu-\\ntions. Superior software is a key differentiation of\\nour digital offering and about 60 percent of our\\napproximately 7,000 employees in research and\\ndevelopment are active in software development.\\nThe majority of our businesses are market leaders\\nwithin their respective segments.

Revenues are generated both\\nfrom direct sales to end users as well as from\\nindirect sales mainly through system integrators\\nand machine builders.\\nThe Robotics & Discrete Automation Business\\nArea had approximately 10,600 employees as of\\nDecember 31, 2021, and generated $3.3 billion of\\nrevenues in 2021.\\n### Products and Services\\nThe Robotics & Discrete Automation Business\\nArea's products and services are delivered\\nthrough two operating Divisions.\\nThe Robotics Division offers a wide range of\\nproducts, solutions and services including robots,\\nrobotics application cells and smart systems,\\nfield services, spare parts, digital services, engi-\\nneering and operations software. This offering\\nprovides customers with increased productivity,\\nquality, flexibility and simplicity for operations,\\ne.g. to meet the challenge of making smaller lots\\nof a larger number of specific products in shorter\\ncycles for today's dynamic global markets and\\ncoping with increasing uncertainty. Robots are\\nalso used in activities or environments which may\\nbe hazardous to employee health and safety, such\\nas repetitive or strenuous lifting, dusty, hot or\\ncold rooms, or painting booths and can help\\ncustomers address labor shortages. Robotics\\nsolutions are used in a wide range of segments\\nfrom automotive OEMs, automotive suppliers,\\nelectronics, general industry, consumer goods,\\nfood and beverage, and warehouse/logistics\\ncenter automation. They are increasingly de-\\nployed in service applications for health care,\\nrestaurants and retail. Typical robotic applica-\\ntions include welding, material handling, machine\\ntending, machining, painting, picking, packing,\\npalletizing and assembly. In 2021, we acquired\\nASTI Mobile Robotics Group (ASTI) adding a broad\\nportfolio of autonomous mobile robot vehicles\\nand solutions.\\nThe Machine Automation Division offers inte-\\ngrated automation solutions based on\\nprogrammable logical controllers, industrial PCs,\\nservo motion, industrial transport systems and\\nmachine vision. It also provides software for\\nengineering and optimization. The range of\\nsolutions are mainly used by machine builders for\\nvarious types of series machines, e.g. for plastics,\\nmetals, printing and packaging.\\n## Customers\\nRobotics & Discrete Automation serves a wide\\nrange of customers. The main customers are\\nactive in industries such as automotive, machine\\nbuilding, metalworking, electronics, food and\\nbeverage and logistics. They include end-users\\nsuch as manufacturers, system integrators and\\nmachine builders.\\n## Sales and Marketing\\nSales are made both through direct sales as well\\nas through third-party channel partners, such as\\nsystem integrators and machine builders. The\\nproportion of direct sales compared to channel\\npartner sales varies among the different indus-\\ntries, product technologies and geographic\\nmarkets.\\n## Competition\\nCompetitors of the Robotics & Discrete Automa-\\ntion Business Area vary by offering and include\\ncompanies such as Fanuc, Kuka, Yaskawa, Epson,\\nDürr, Staubli, Universal Robots, Rockwell Automa-\\ntion, Siemens, Mitsubishi Electric and Beckhoff.\\n## Capital Expenditures\\nThe Robotics & Discrete Automation Business\\nArea's capital expenditures for property, plant\\nand equipment totaled $96 million in 2021,\\ncompared to $65 million in 2020. Principal invest-\\nments in 2021 were primarily related to research\\nand development and training facilities, especially\\nthe new Machine Automation Division global\\ninnovation and training campus in Austria, and\\nupgrades and equipment replacement. In 2021,\\nEurope represented 75 percent of capital expendi-\\ntures, followed by Asia, Middle East and Africa\\n(23 percent) and the Americas (2 percent).\\n—\\n## Corporate and Other\\nCorporate and Other includes core headquarter\\nfunctions, real estate activities, Corporate Trea-\\nsury Operations, Global Business Services (GBS),\\nthe investment in Hitachi Energy and other minor\\nbusiness activities. Certain strategic investments\\nmanaged by ABB Technology Ventures are also\",\n",

The remaining activities of\\ncertain EPC projects which we are completing and\\nare in a wind-down phase are reported as\\nnon-core businesses within Corporate and Other.\\nIn addition, the historical business activities of\\ncertain divested businesses are presented in\\nCorporate and Other. These include the\\nhigh-voltage cables business, steel structures and\\ncertain EPC contracts relating to the oil and gas\\nindustry.\\nCorporate headquarters and stewardship activi-\\nties include the operations of our corporate\\nheadquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, as well as\\nlimited corporate-related activities in some\\ncountries. These activities cover staff functions\\nwith group-wide responsibilities, such as\\naccounting and financial reporting, corporate\\nfinance and corporate treasury, taxes, financial\\nplanning and analysis, internal audit, legal and\\nintegrity, compliance, risk management and\\ninsurance, corporate communications, informa-\\ntion systems and investor relations.\\nGBS operates shared service centers globally\\nthrough a network of five hubs and consists of\\nboth expert and transactional services in the\\nareas of human resources, finance, information\\nservices, legal, real estate, customer contact\\ncenters, global travel services and other ancillary\\nactivities. GBS also staffs and maintains front\\noffices in most countries. The costs in GBS are\\nincurred primarily for the benefit of the Business\\nAreas, who are charged for their use of the\\nservices and the related number of employees are\\nallocated to the Business Areas. GBS also provides\\nservices to third-parties under transitional\\nservice agreements in relation to certain divested\\nbusinesses, the largest of which is the Power\\nGrids business.\\nA significant portion of the costs for GBS and\\nother shared corporate overhead costs are\\ncharged to the operating businesses. Up until the\\ndivestment of the Power Grids business on July 1,\\n2020, overhead and other management costs,\\nincluding GBS costs, which would have been\\nallocated or charged to our Power Grids business,\\nand which were not directly attributable to this\\nbusiness, have not been allocated to the discon-\\ntinued operation and are included in Corporate\\nand Other as \"stranded costs\".\\nCorporate and Other had approximately\\n1000 employees at December 31, 2021, of which\\napproximately 200 pertain to our non-core\\nbusinesses.\\n—\\n## Discontinued operations\\nIn July 2020, we divested 80.1 percent of our\\nPower Grids business to Hitachi Ltd. As a result,\\nthe Power Grids business is reported as discon-\\ntinued operations in the Consolidated Financial\\nStatements for all years presented. See \"Note 3\\n- Discontinued operations\" to our Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements.\\n### Power Grids business\\nThe former Power Grids business of ABB delivered\\nproducts, systems, software and service solu-\\ntions across the power value chain for utility,\\nindustry and transport & infrastructure\\ncustomers.\\nThe Power Grids business operated worldwide\\nwith a globally diversified manufacturing, engi-\\nneering, and research and development footprint.\\nDirect sales accounted for the majority of total\\nrevenues generated by the business while exter-\\nnal channel partners such as EPCs, wholesalers,\\ndistributors and OEMs accounted for the rest.\\n#### Products and Services\\nThe Grid Automation operation supplied substa-\\ntion automation products, systems and services.\\nIt also provided Supervisory Control and Data\\nAcquisition (SCADA) systems for transmission\\nand distribution networks as well as a range of\\nwireless, fiber optic and powerline carrier-based\\ntelecommunication technologies for\\nmission-critical applications and also offered\\ngrid-edge and microgrid solutions. Its enterprise\\nsoftware portfolio provided solutions for manag-\\ning and optimizing assets, operations, logistics,\\nfinancials and HR, reducing operating costs and\\nimproving productivity for customers.\\nThe Grid Integration operation was a leading\\nprovider of integration and transmission solu-\\ntions such as High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC).\\nAnother key part of the portfolio was the Flexible\\nAlternating Current Transmission Systems\\n(FACTS) business, which comprises Static Var\\nCompensation (SVC) and static compensator\\n(STATCOM) technologies to address stability and',\n",

The Grid Integration opera-\\ntion's portfolio also included a range of\\nhigh-power semiconductors, a core technology\\nfor power electronics deployed in HVDC, FACTS\\nand rail applications. The Grid Integration opera-\\ntion also provided transmission and distribution\\nsubstations and associated lifecycle services.\\nThese substations are used in utility and\\nnon-utility applications including rail, data cen-\\nters and various industries. Battery energy\\nstorage solutions and shore-to-ship power supply\\nwere also part of the customer offering.\\nThe High Voltage products operation was a\\nprovider of high voltage switchgear up to 1200 kV\\nAC and 1100 kV DC with a portfolio spanning\\nair-insulated, gas-insulated and hybrid technolo-\\ngies. It also manufactured generator circuit\\nbreakers, a key product for integrating large\\npower plants into the grid. The portfolio also\\nincluded a broad range of capacitors and filters\\nthat facilitate power quality, instrument trans-\\nformers and other substation components.\\nThe Transformers operation supplied transform-\\ners that are an integral component found across\\nthe power value chain, enabling the reliable,\\nefficient and safe conversion of voltage levels.\\nThe product range included dry- and\\nliquid-distribution transformers, traction trans-\\nformers for rail applications and special\\napplication transformers plus related compo-\\nnents, for example, insulation kits, bushings and\\nother transformer accessories.\\nThe Power Grids business also had an extensive\\nportfolio of service offerings across the value\\nchain. The portfolio included spare parts, condi-\\ntion monitoring and maintenance services,\\non- and off-site repairs as well as retrofits and\\nupgrades. Advanced software-based monitoring\\nand advisory services further enhanced the\\nportfolio.\\n—\\n### Capital expenditures\\nTotal capital expenditures for property, plant and\\nequipment and intangible assets (excluding\\nintangibles acquired through business combina-\\ntions) amounted to $820 million, $694 million and\\n$762 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\\nIn 2021 and 2020, capital expenditures were\\n8 percent and 24 percent lower, respectively, than\\ndepreciation and amortization. Excluding\\nacquisition-related amortization, capital expendi-\\ntures were 28 percent higher in 2021 and 6 percent\\nhigher in 2020, respectively, than depreciation\\nand amortization.\\nCapital expenditures in 2021 remained primarily\\nfocused in mature markets, reflecting the geo-\\ngraphic distribution of our existing production\\nfacilities. Capital expenditures in Europe and\\nNorth America in 2021 were driven primarily by\\nupgrades and maintenance of existing production\\nfacilities, mainly in the U.S., Austria, Italy, Switzer-\\nland, Finland and Sweden. Capital expenditures in\\nAustria included continued investment in the\\nstate-of-the-art innovation and training campus,\\nwhich is planned to become one of our largest\\nresearch and development centers for new auto-\\nmation technologies. We also are\\nconstructing a new facility in Italy for our\\nE-mobility Division. This investment aims to serve\\nas a global center of excellence and production\\nsite for electric vehicle charging infrastructure.\\nOur capital expenditures in emerging markets\\ncontinued to remain primarily concentrated in\\nChina and focus on increasing existing produc-\\ntion capacity. In Asia, we continued our significant\\ninvestments in China investing in the new auto-\\nmated and flexible robotics factory and also\\npurchasing a significant formerly leased property.\\nThe share of emerging markets capital expendi-\\ntures as a percentage of total capital\\nexpenditures in 2021 and 2020 was 33 percent and\\n22 percent, respectively.\\nAt December 31, 2021, construction in progress\\nfor property, plant and equipment was $522 mil-\\nlion, mainly in the U.S., Switzerland, Germany,\\nSweden, Italy, China and India while at Decem-\\nber 31, 2020, construction in progress for\\nproperty, plant and equipment was $505 million,\\nmainly in the U.S., Switzerland, Austria, Germany\\nand China.\\nOur capital expenditures relate primarily to\\nproperty, plant and equipment and are funded\\nprimarily through cash flows from operating\\nactivities. For 2022, we estimate the expenditures\\nfor property, plant and equipment will be higher\\nthan our annual depreciation and amortization\\ncharge, excluding acquisition-related\\namortization.\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n—\\nSupplies and raw materials\\n===\\nWe purchase a variety of supplies and products\\nwhich contain raw materials for use in our produc-\\ntion and project execution processes. The primary\\nmaterials used in our products, by weight, are\\ncopper, aluminum, steel, mineral oil and various\\nplastics. We also purchase a wide variety of\\nfabricated products, electronic components and\\nsystems. We operate a worldwide supply chain\\nmanagement network with employees dedicated\\nto this function in our Business Areas, Divisions\\nand in key countries. Our supply chain operations\\nconsists of a number of teams, each focusing on\\ndifferent product categories. These category\\nteams take advantage of opportunities to lever-\\nage the scale of ABB on a global, Business Area\\nand/or Division level, as appropriate, to optimize\\nthe efficiency of our supply networks in a sustain-\\nable manner.\\nOur supply chain management organization\\'s\\nactivities and objectives include:\\n· pool and leverage procurement of materials\\nand services,\\n· provide transparency of ABB\\'s global spending\\nthrough a comprehensive performance and\\nreporting system linked to our enterprise\\nresource planning (ERP) systems,\\n· strengthen ABB\\'s supply chain network by\\nimplementing an effective product category\\nmanagement structure and extensive\\ncompetency-based training, and\\n· monitor and develop our supply base to ensure\\nsustainability, both in terms of materials and\\nprocesses used.\\nWe buy many categories of products which con-\\ntain steel, copper, aluminum, crude oil and other\\ncommodities. Continuing global economic growth\\nin many emerging economies, coupled with the\\nvolatility in foreign currency exchange rates, has\\nled to significant fluctuations in these raw mate-\\nrial costs over the last few years. While we expect\\nglobal commodity prices to remain highly volatile,\\nwe expect to offset some market volatility\\nthrough the use of long-term contracts and global\\nsourcing.\\nWe seek to mitigate the majority of our exposure\\nto commodity price risk by entering into deriva-\\ntive contracts. For example, we manage copper,\\nsilver and aluminum price risk using principally\\nswap contracts based on prices for these com-\\nmodities quoted on leading exchanges. ABB\\'s\\nhedging policy is designed to safeguard margins\\nby minimizing price volatility and providing\\na stable cost base during order execution. In\\naddition to using derivatives to reduce our expo-\\nsure to fluctuations in raw materials prices, in\\nsome cases we can reduce this risk by incorporat-\\ning changes in raw materials prices into the prices\\nof our end products (through price escala-\\ntion clauses).\\nOverall, during 2021, supply chain management\\npersonnel in our businesses, and in the countries\\nin which we operate, along with the category\\nteams, continued to focus on value chain optimi-\\nzation efforts in all areas, while maintaining and\\nimproving quality and delivery performance.\\nResponding to the challenges of overall global\\nsupply chain constraints, each Business Area\\nquickly implemented a task force to mitigate\\nsupply chain shortages. The Business Areas\\nexperienced some delays in supplier deliveries\\nand product shortages for various categories\\nsuch as semiconductors and other raw materials\\nas well as constraints in the transportation of\\ninbound supplies. However, we responded to\\nthese challenges and took mitigating actions\\nsuch as building up buffer stocks, approving new\\nsuppliers, changing supplier splits, combined\\nwith daily, weekly and monthly task force project\\nfollow ups. We have, to a large extent, been able\\nto mitigate most disruptions, maintain a competi-\\ntive service level and support our business\\ngrowth, while maintaining delivery schedules to\\nour customers.\\nIn August 2012, the SEC issued its final rules\\nregarding \"Conflict Minerals\", as required by\\nsection 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\\nReform and Consumer Protection Act. We initi-\\nated conflict minerals processes in 2013 and have\\ncontinuously aimed at improving and tailoring the\\nprocesses to our value chain. We continue to work\\nwith our suppliers and customers, to enable us to\\ncomply with the rules and disclosure obligations.\\nFurther information on ABB\\'s Conflict Minerals\\npolicy and supplier requirements can be found\\nunder \"Material Compliance\" at global.abb/\\ngroup/en/about.supplying.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n—\\nPatents and trademarks\\n===\\nWhile we are not materially dependent on any one\\nof our intellectual properties, as a\\ntechnology-driven company, we believe that\\nintellectual property rights are crucial to protect\\nthe assets of our business. Over the past ten\\nyears, we have continued to substantially add new\\napplications to our existing first patent filings,\\nand we intend to continue our aggressive\\napproach to seeking patent protection. As of\\nDecember 31, 2021, we have approximately\\n25,000 patent applications and registrations, of\\nwhich approximately 5,500 are pending applica-\\ntions. These patents include more than\\n3,500 utility model and design applications and\\nregistrations, of which approximately 200 are\\npending applications. In 2021, we filed more than\\n2,250 patents, utility model and design applica-\\ntions for more than 1,250 inventions. Based on\\nour existing intellectual property strategy, we\\nbelieve that we have adequate control over our\\ncore technologies. The \"ABB\" trademarks and\\nlogo are protected in all of the countries in which\\nwe operate. We proactively assert our intellectual\\nproperty rights to safeguard the reputation\\nassociated with the ABB technology and brand.\\nWhile these intellectual property rights are funda-\\nmental to all of our businesses, there is no\\ndependency of the business on any single patent,\\nutility model or design application.\\n## —\\n## Management overview\\nDuring 2021, we saw a strong recovery from the\\npandemic-related disruptions of 2020. It also was\\nthe first full fiscal year where we operated under\\nour decentralized operating model, the ABB Way.\\nIn 2021, we have seen improved efficiencies from\\nthis new way of operating and we expect the\\nincreased transparency, accountability and speed\\nto further support future growth and profitability.\\nAdditionally, we made progress in reshaping our\\nbusiness portfolio, completing the divestment of\\nthe Mechanical Power Transmission business, as\\nwe continue to be fully focused on electrification\\nand automation. This transaction completes the\\nfirst of the three planned Divisional exits previ-\\nously announced in 2020.\\nActive portfolio management is part of our per-\\nformance culture. On the back of systematic\\nportfolio reviews we ascertain whether ultimately\\nABB is the best owner of the different businesses.\\nAs a result, we have successfully divested the\\nMechanical Power Transmission Division during\\n2021. We continue to make progress on the exit of\\nthe Turbocharging Division, where we are cur-\\nrently running a dual track process for a spin-off\\nor divestment, and plan to exit the Power Conver-\\nsion Division. At the same time, we are\\ncarving-out the E-mobility Division and work\\ntowards an initial public offering to create a\\nplatform for accelerated growth and value cre-\\nation. We plan to remain a majority owner of the\\nnew company.\\nIn addition, our active portfolio management\\nprocess is driving decisions within the Divisions\\nto improve or exit areas of underperformance,\\nsupporting improved performance ambitions.\\nFurther, we intend to pursue strategic partner-\\nships as well as bolt-on acquisitions driven by the\\nDivisions. In 2021, we acquired ASTI Mobile Robot-\\nics Group, a global leader in the high-growth\\nautonomous mobile robots market with a broad\\nportfolio of vehicles and software. As part of our\\nfuture strategy we aim to complete five or more\\nbolt-on acquisitions each year.\\n### Business progress\\nDuring 2021, demand for ABB\\'s offering recovered\\nfrom the low level in 2020 when the adverse\\nbusiness impact of the pandemic was most\\nsignificant. Orders and revenues increased in all\\nBusiness Areas. Demand increased year-on-year in\\nall regions with the Americas seeing the highest\\ngrowth, while the increase was lower in Asia,\\nMiddle East and Africa as China had already\\nstarted to recover in 2020. While short-cycle\\nproduct demand recovered relatively quickly from\\nthe sharp downturn seen at the onset of the\\npandemic, project activities, particularly in pro-\\ncess industries, predominantly picked-up during\\nthe second half of 2021. The loosening of various\\npandemic-related travel restrictions allowed\\nfor a more significant improvement in\\nservice-related activities.',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\nWhile our orders increased 20 percent in 2021,\\nrevenues only grew by 11 percent. Supply chain\\nconstraints, and imbalances in the overall supply\\nchain limited our ability to convert orders into\\nactual deliveries resulting in an increase of our\\norder backlog by 16 percent to $16.6 billion at the\\nend of the year.\\nGroup profitability showed strong improvement\\nduring 2021 with segment profit (Operational\\nEBITA) higher in all Business Areas and continued\\nprogress towards a lean corporate function. The\\nresult was driven by better volumes, continuous\\nimprovements, improved internal efficiency and\\nthe absence of certain larger non-core project\\nlosses incurred in 2020. Active price management\\nand productivity gains were able to offset in-\\ncreasing raw material costs and general cost\\ninflation emphasized by the tight supply situation\\nover the year. While some costs such as discre-\\ntionary travel or certain marketing costs are still\\nexpected to rebalance from low pandemic levels,\\nwe believe we are on track to achieve our future\\nbusiness targets.\\nThe profitability improvement as well as lower\\ncash costs for transformation initiatives have also\\nallowed us to achieve strong cash generation,\\nwith cash flows from operating activities in\\ncontinuing operations improving to $3.3 billion in\\n2021, an increase of 78 percent compared to 2020.\\nWe continued to make organic growth invest-\\nments in a disciplined manner, prioritizing\\nresearch and development while reducing admin-\\nistrative costs. Total non-order related research\\nand development was $1.2 billion in 2021, or\\n4.2 percent of revenues. We also completed key\\nacquisitions and divestments in 2021, strengthen-\\ning our portfolio.\\n## Capital allocation\\nOur capital allocation priorities are unchanged:\\n· funding organic growth, research and\\ndevelopment, and capital expenditures at\\nattractive returns,\\n· paying a rising, sustainable dividend per share\\nover time,\\n· investing in value-creating acquisitions, and\\n· returning additional cash to shareholders.\\nWe expect that our improved cash generation, on\\nthe back of the ABB Way operating model, will\\nenhance our flexibility to invest in both organic\\ngrowth and bolt-on acquisitions, while providing\\nattractive returns to shareholders.\\nAt the 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM), the\\nBoard of Directors is proposing a dividend of\\n0.82 Swiss francs per share. We also plan to\\ncontinue our announced share buyback to return\\n$7.8 billion of cash proceeds from the Power Grids\\ndivestment to shareholders. At December 31,\\n2021, under the initial and follow-up share buy-\\nback programs, we had cumulatively purchased\\nshares for approximately $5.5 billion.\\n## Updated financial target framework\\nDuring 2021, we raised our growth target to\\n4 to 7 percent (up from 3 to 5 percent) annual\\naverage revenue growth, through an economic\\ncycle and in constant currencies. This includes\\n3 to 5 percent organic growth and 1 to 2 percent\\nfrom acquired growth.\\nFor the Operational EBITA margin, we have re-\\nmoved the previous margin ranges and raised our\\ntarget to at least 15 percent as from 2023 (from\\nupper half of 13 to 16 percent range in 2023).\\nThe other targets within our financial framework\\nremain unchanged:\\n· Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of 15 to\\n20 percent,\\n· Cash conversion to net income of approximately\\n100 percent, and\\n. Basic EPS growth above revenue growth.\\n## Sustainability strategy 2030\\nWith our 2030 sustainability strategy, we are\\nactively contributing to a more sustainable world,\\nleading by example in our own operations and\\npartnering with customers and suppliers to\\nenable a low-carbon society, preserve resources\\nand promote social progress. Our sustainability\\nfocus is part of ABB's commitment to responsible\\nbusiness practices, which are at the center of our\\ncomprehensive governance framework, based on\\nintegrity and transparency.\\nAmongst other focus areas in 2021, we unveiled,\\nat the Capital Markets Day 2021, our circularity\\nframework covering every stage of the product\\nlifecycle to preserve resources. It includes four\\nstages: circular design and sourcing, resource\\nefficient operations, optimized use phase and\\nresponsible end of life. The goal is to have\\n80 percent of ABB products, solutions and ser-\\nvices covered by the circularity framework by\\n2030, with our progress measured against a set of\\nKPIs.

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\nCritical accounting policies and\\nestimates\\n===\\n## General\\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial State-\\nments in accordance with U.S. GAAP and present\\nthese in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.\\nThe preparation of our financial statements\\nrequires us to make assumptions and estimates\\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets,\\nliabilities, revenues and expenses and the related\\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We\\nevaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis (see\\n\"Note 2 - Significant accounting policies\" to our\\nConsolidated Financial Statements for a listing of\\nour most significant accounting estimates).\\nWhere appropriate, we base our estimates on\\nhistorical experience and on various other as-\\nsumptions that we believe to be reasonable under\\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the\\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying\\nvalues of assets and liabilities that are not readily\\napparent from other sources. Actual results may\\ndiffer from our estimates and assumptions.\\nWe deem an accounting policy to be critical if it\\nrequires an accounting estimate to be made\\nbased on assumptions about matters that are\\nhighly uncertain at the time the estimate is made\\nand if different estimates that reasonably could\\nhave been used, or if changes in the accounting\\nestimates that are reasonably likely to occur\\nperiodically, could materially impact our Consoli-\\ndated Financial Statements. We also deem an\\naccounting policy to be critical when the applica-\\ntion of such policy is essential to our ongoing\\noperations. We believe the following critical\\naccounting policies require us to make subjective\\njudgments, often as a result of the need to make\\nestimates regarding matters that are inherently\\nuncertain and material to our Consolidated Finan-\\ncial Statements. These policies should be\\nconsidered when reading our Consolidated Finan-\\ncial Statements.\\n## Revenue recognition\\nA customer contract exists if collectability under\\nthe contract is considered probable, the contract\\nhas commercial substance, contains payment\\nterms, the rights and commitments of both\\nparties, and has been approved. By analyzing the\\ntype, terms and conditions of each contract or\\narrangement with a customer, we determine\\nwhich revenue recognition method applies.\\nWe recognize revenues when control of goods or\\nservices is transferred to customers in an amount\\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to be\\nentitled to in exchange for these goods or ser-\\nvices. Control is transferred when the customer\\nhas the ability to direct the use and obtain the\\nbenefits from the goods or services.\\nThe percentage-of-completion method of ac-\\ncounting is generally used when recognizing\\nrevenue on an over time basis and involves the use\\nof assumptions and projections, principally\\nrelating to future material, labor, subcontractor\\nand project-related overhead costs as well as\\nestimates of the amount of variable consideration\\nto which we expect to be entitled. As a conse-\\nquence, there is a risk that total contract costs or\\nthe amount of variable consideration will, respec-\\ntively, either exceed or be lower than those we\\noriginally estimated (based on all information\\nreasonably available to us) and the margin will\\ndecrease or the contract may become unprofit-\\nable. This risk increases if the duration\\nof a contract increases because there is a higher\\nprobability that the circumstances upon which we\\noriginally developed our estimates will change,\\nresulting in increased costs that we may not\\nrecover. Factors that could cause costs to in-\\ncrease include:\\n· unanticipated technical problems with\\nequipment supplied or developed by us which\\nmay require us to incur additional costs\\nto remedy,\\n· changes in the cost of components, materials\\nor labor,\\n· difficulties in obtaining required governmental\\npermits or approvals,\\n· project modifications creating\\nunanticipated costs,\\n· suppliers\\' or subcontractors\\' failure to perform,\\nand\\n· delays caused by unexpected conditions\\nor events.\\nChanges in our initial assumptions, which we\\nreview on a regular basis between balance sheet\\ndates, may result in revisions to estimated costs,\\ncurrent earnings and anticipated earnings. We\\nrecognize these changes in the period in which\\nthe changes in estimates are determined. By',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nrecognizing changes in estimates cumulatively,\\nrecorded revenue and costs to date reflect the\\ncurrent estimates of the stage of completion of\\neach project. Additionally, losses on such con-\\ntracts are recognized in the period when they are\\nidentified and are based upon the anticipated\\nexcess of contract costs over the related contract\\nrevenues.\\n## Pension and other\\npostretirement benefits\\nAs more fully described in \"Note 17 - Employee\\nbenefits\" to our Consolidated Financial State-\\nments, we have a number of defined benefit\\npension and other postretirement plans and\\nrecognize an asset for a plan\\'s overfunded status\\nor a liability for a plan\\'s underfunded status in our\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. We measure\\nsuch a plan\\'s assets and obligations that deter-\\nmine its funded status as of the end of the year.\\nSignificant differences between assumptions and\\nactual experience, or significant changes in\\nassumptions, may materially affect the pension\\nobligations. The effects of actual results differing\\nfrom assumptions and the changing of assump-\\ntions are included in net actuarial loss within\\n\"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\".\\nWe recognize actuarial gains and losses gradually\\nover time. Any cumulative unrecognized actuarial\\ngain or loss that exceeds 10 percent of the greater\\nof the present value of the projected benefit\\nobligation (PBO) and the fair value of plan assets\\nis recognized in earnings over the expected\\naverage remaining working lives of the employees\\nparticipating in the plan, or the expected average\\nremaining lifetime of the inactive plan partici-\\npants if the plan is comprised of all or almost all\\ninactive participants. Otherwise, the actuarial\\ngain or loss is not recognized in the Consolidated\\nIncome Statements.\\nWe use actuarial valuations to determine our\\npension and postretirement benefit costs and\\ncredits. The amounts calculated depend on a\\nvariety of key assumptions, including discount\\nrates, mortality rates and expected return on plan\\nassets. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to\\nconsider current market conditions in making\\nthese assumptions. In particular, the discount\\nrates are reviewed annually based on changes in\\nlong-term, highly-rated corporate bond yields.\\nDecreases in the discount rates result in an in-\\ncrease in the PBO and in pension costs.\\nConversely, an increase in the discount rates\\nresults in a decrease in the PBO and in pension\\ncosts. The mortality assumptions are reviewed\\nannually by management. Decreases in mortality\\nrates result in an increase in the PBO and in pen-\\nsion costs. Conversely, an increase in mortality\\nrates results in a decrease in the PBO and in\\npension costs.\\nHolding all other assumptions constant, a\\n0.25 percentage-point decrease in the discount\\nrate would have increased the PBO related to our\\ndefined benefit pension plans by $262 million\\nwhile a 0.25 percentage-point increase in the\\ndiscount rate would have decreased the PBO\\nrelated to our defined benefit pension plans by\\n$254 million.\\nThe expected return on plan assets is reviewed\\nregularly and considered for adjustment annually\\nbased upon the target asset allocations and\\nrepresents the long-term return expected to be\\nachieved. Decreases in the expected return on\\nplan assets result in an increase to pension costs.\\nHolding all other assumptions constant, an in-\\ncrease or decrease of 0.25 percentage points in\\nthe expected long-term rate of asset return would\\nhave decreased or increased, respectively, the net\\nperiodic benefit cost in 2021 by $21 million.\\nThe funded status, which can increase or decrease\\nbased on the performance of the financial mar-\\nkets or changes in our assumptions, does not\\nrepresent a mandatory short-term cash obliga-\\ntion. Instead, the funded status of a defined\\nbenefit pension plan is the difference between\\nthe PBO and the fair value of the plan assets. At\\nDecember 31, 2021, our defined benefit pension\\nplans were $27 million overfunded compared to\\nan underfunding of $656 million at December 31,\\n2020. Our other postretirement plans were under-\\nfunded by $71 million and $98 million at\\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\n## Income taxes\\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial State-\\nments, we are required to estimate income taxes\\nin each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\\nTax expense from continuing operations is recon-\\nciled from the weighted-average global tax rate\\n(rather than from the Swiss domestic statutory\\ntax rate). As the parent company of the ABB\\nGroup, ABB Ltd, is domiciled in Switzerland,\\nincome which has been generated in jurisdictions\\noutside of Switzerland (hereafter \"foreign juris-\\ndictions\") and has already been subject to\\ncorporate income tax in those foreign jurisdic-\\ntions is, to a large extent, tax exempt in\\nSwitzerland. Therefore, generally no or only\\nlimited Swiss income tax has to be provided for\\non the repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiar-\\nies. There is no requirement in Switzerland',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nfor a parent company of a group to file a tax\\nreturn of the group determining domestic and\\nforeign pre-tax income and as our consolidated\\nincome from continuing operations is predomi-\\nnantly earned outside of Switzerland, corporate\\nincome tax in foreign jurisdictions largely deter-\\nmines our global weighted-average tax rate.\\nWe account for deferred taxes by using the asset\\nand liability method. Under this method, we\\ndetermine deferred tax assets and liabilities\\nbased on temporary differences between the\\nfinancial reporting and the tax bases of assets\\nand liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\\nare measured using the enacted tax rates and\\nlaws that are expected to be in effect when the\\ndifferences are expected to reverse. We recog-\\nnize a deferred tax asset when it is more likely\\nthan not that the asset will be realized. We regu-\\nlarly review our deferred tax assets for\\nrecoverability and establish a valuation allowance\\nbased upon historical losses, projected future\\ntaxable income and the expected timing of the\\nreversals of existing temporary differences. To\\nthe extent we increase or decrease this allowance\\nin a period, we recognize the change in the allow-\\nance within \"Income tax expense\" in the\\nConsolidated Income Statements unless the\\nchange relates to discontinued operations, in\\nwhich case the change is recorded in \"Income\\nfrom discontinued operations, net of tax\". Unfore-\\nseen changes in tax rates and tax laws, as well as\\ndifferences in the projected taxable income as\\ncompared to the actual taxable income, may\\naffect these estimates.\\nCertain countries levy withholding taxes, dividend\\ndistribution taxes or additional corporate income\\ntaxes (hereafter \"withholding taxes\") on dividend\\ndistributions. Such taxes cannot always be fully\\nreclaimed by the shareholder, although they have\\nto be declared and withheld by the subsidiary.\\nSwitzerland has concluded double taxation\\ntreaties with many countries in which we operate.\\nThese treaties either eliminate or reduce such\\nwithholding taxes on dividend distributions. It is\\nour policy to distribute retained earnings of\\nsubsidiaries, insofar as such earnings are not\\npermanently reinvested or no other reasons exist\\nthat would prevent the subsidiary from distribut-\\ning them. No deferred tax liability is set up, if\\nretained earnings are considered as indefinitely\\nreinvested, and used for financing current opera-\\ntions as well as business growth through working\\ncapital and capital expenditure in those countries.\\nWe operate in numerous tax jurisdictions and,\\nas a result, are regularly subject to audit by tax\\nauthorities, including for transfer pricing. We\\nprovide for tax contingencies whenever it is\\ndeemed more likely than not that a tax asset has\\nbeen impaired or a tax liability has been incurred\\nfor events such as tax claims or changes in tax\\nlaws. Contingency provisions are recorded based\\non the technical merits of our filing position,\\nconsidering the applicable tax laws and OECD\\nguidelines and are based on our evaluations of the\\nfacts and circumstances as of the end of each\\nreporting period. Changes in the facts and cir-\\ncumstances could result in a material change to\\nthe tax accruals. Although we believe that our tax\\nestimates are reasonable and that appropriate\\ntax reserves have been made, the final determina-\\ntion of tax audits and any related litigation could\\nbe different than that which is reflected in our\\nincome tax provisions and accruals.\\nAn estimated loss from a tax contingency must be\\naccrued as a charge to income if it is more likely\\nthan not that a tax asset has been impaired\\nor a tax liability has been incurred and the amount\\nof the loss can be reasonably estimated. We\\napply a two-step approach to recognize and\\nmeasure uncertainty in income taxes. The first\\nstep is to evaluate the tax position for recognition\\nby determining if the weight of available evidence\\nindicates that it is more likely than not that the\\nposition will be sustained on audit, including\\nresolution of related appeals or litigation pro-\\ncesses, if any. The second step is to measure the\\ntax benefit as the largest amount which is more\\nthan 50 percent likely of being realized upon\\nultimate settlement. The required amount of\\nprovisions for contingencies of any type may\\nchange in the future due to new developments.\\n## Goodwill and intangible assets\\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually as of\\nOctober 1, or more frequently if events or circum-\\nstances indicate the carrying value may not be\\nrecoverable. We use either a qualitative or quanti-\\ntative assessment method for each reporting\\nunit.\\nAs each of our Divisions have full ownership and\\naccountability for their respective strategies,\\nperformance and resources, we have determined\\nour reporting units to be at the Division level,\\nwhich is one level below our operating segments\\nof Electrification, Motion, Process Automation\\nand Robotics & Discrete Automation.\\nWhen performing the qualitative assessment, we\\nfirst determine, for a reporting unit, factors which\\nwould affect the fair value of the reporting unit\\nincluding: (i) macroeconomic conditions related\\nto the business, (ii) industry and market trends,\\nand (iii) the overall future financial performance\\nand future opportunities in the markets in which\\nthe business operates. We then consider how',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nthese factors would impact the most recent\\nquantitative analysis of the reporting unit\\'s fair\\nvalue. Key assumptions in determining the fair\\nvalue of the reporting unit include the projected\\nlevel of business operations, the reporting unit\\'s\\nweighted-average cost of capital, the income tax\\nrate and the terminal growth rate.\\nDuring 2021, we added three new Divisions by\\nsplitting two existing ones into multiple stand-\\nalone Divisions and announced (in July 2021) the\\ndivestment of the Mechanical Power Transmission\\nDivision, resulting in twenty reporting units in\\ntotal for the Group at October 1, 2021. For each\\nchange in reporting unit which arose during 2021,\\nan interim quantitative impairment test was\\nconducted before and after the change. In both\\nthe \"before\" and \"after\" tests, it was concluded\\nthat the fair value of the reporting units exceeded\\nthe carrying value by a significant amount.\\nIn 2020, prior to the adoption of the new \"ABB\\nWay\" operating model on July 1, 2020, goodwill\\nwas generally assessed at the level of ABB\\'s\\noperating segments (one level above the Division,\\nwith the exception of Process Automation where\\nthe reporting units were the same as the Divi-\\nsions) while after the change, goodwill\\nimpairment was assessed at the Division level.\\nAlthough the new operating model resulted only\\nin an allocation of goodwill within the operating\\nsegments and did not change the segment level\\ngoodwill, an interim quantitative impairment test\\nwas conducted before and after the July 1 change.\\nIn the \"before\" test, it was concluded that the fair\\nvalue of our reporting units exceeded the carrying\\nvalue under the historical reporting unit structure.\\nFor the impairment test performed immediately\\nafter the change in reporting units, the fair value\\nof each of the eighteen reporting units was\\ndetermined using a discounted cash flow fair\\nvalue estimate based on objective information at\\nthe measurement date. The significant assump-\\ntions used to develop the estimates of fair value\\nfor each reporting unit included our best esti-\\nmates of the expected future results and discount\\nrates specific to the reporting unit. Determining\\nthe projected future cash flows required signifi-\\ncant judgments and estimates involving variables\\nsuch as future sales volumes, sales prices, pro-\\nduction and other operating costs, capital\\nexpenditures, net working capital requirements\\nand other economic factors such as the continued\\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The fair value\\nestimates were based on assumptions that we\\nbelieved to be reasonable, but which were inher-\\nently uncertain and thus, actual results may differ\\nfrom those estimates. Sensitivity analyses were\\nperformed around certain of these assumptions\\nin order to assess the reasonableness of the\\nassumptions and the resulting estimated\\nfair values.\\nThe 2020 interim quantitative impairment test\\nindicated that, with the exception of the Machine\\nAutomation reporting unit within the Robotics &\\nDiscrete Automation operating segment, the\\nestimated fair values of our reporting units were\\nsubstantially in excess of their carrying value. The\\ncontraction of the global economy in 2020, partic-\\nularly in end-customer industries and\\nconsiderable uncertainty around the continued\\npace of macroeconomic recovery generally led\\nto a reduction in the fair values of the reporting\\nunits, thus also affecting the Machine Automation\\nreporting unit. At the Division level, this reporting\\nunit does not benefit from shared cash flows\\ngenerated within an entire operating segment. In\\naddition, the book value of the Machine Automa-\\ntion Division includes a significant amount of\\nintangible assets recognized in past acquisitions,\\nresulting in a proportionately higher book value\\nthan the other reporting unit within the Robotics\\n& Discrete Automation operating segment. These\\nfactors led to the carrying value of the Machine\\nAutomation reporting unit exceeding its fair\\nvalue. During 2020, a goodwill impairment charge\\nof $290 million was recorded to reduce the carry-\\ning value of this reporting unit to its implied fair\\nvalue. The remaining goodwill for the Machine\\nAutomation reporting unit was $554 million as of\\nDecember 31, 2020. Since the carrying value of\\nthis reporting unit was reduced to its fair value as\\nof July 1, 2020, any material adverse changes such\\nas market deterioration or changes in the com-\\npetitive landscape could result in future\\nimpairment charges.\\nAt October 1, 2021 and 2020, respectively, we\\nperformed qualitative assessments and deter-\\nmined that it was not more likely than not that the\\nfair value for each of these reporting units was\\nbelow the carrying value. As a result, we con-\\ncluded that it was not necessary to perform the\\nquantitative impairment test.\\nIntangible assets are reviewed for recoverability\\nupon the occurrence of certain triggering events\\n(such as a decision to divest a business or pro-\\njected losses of an entity) or whenever events or\\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carry-\\ning amount may not be recoverable. We record\\nimpairment charges other than impairments of\\ngoodwill in \"Other income (expense), net\" in our\\nConsolidated Income Statements, unless they\\nrelate to a discontinued operation, in which case\\nthe charges are recorded in \"Income from discon-\\ntinued operations, net of tax\".',\n",

Our research and development\\nfocuses on developing and commercializing the\\ntechnologies, products and solutions of our\\nbusinesses that are of strategic importance to our\\nfuture growth. In 2021, we invested $1,219 million,\\nor approximately 4.2 percent of our 2021 consoli-\\ndated revenues, on research and development\\nactivities in our continuing operations. We also\\nhad expenditures of $53 million, or approximately\\n0.2 percent of our 2021 consolidated revenues, on\\norder-related development activities. These are\\ncustomer- and project-specific development\\nefforts that we undertake to develop or adapt\\nequipment and systems to the unique needs of\\nour customers in connection with specific orders\\nor projects.\\nIn addition to continuous product development,\\nand order-related engineering work, we develop\\nplatforms for technology applications in our\\nbusinesses in our research and development\\nlaboratories, which operate on a global basis,\\nsuch as our ABB Ability™ platform. Through active\\nmanagement of our investment in research and\\ndevelopment, we seek to maintain a balance\\nbetween short-term and long-term research and\\ndevelopment programs and optimize our return\\non investment. We protect these results by hold-\\ning patents, copyrights and other appropriate\\nintellectual property protection.\\nTo complement our business-focused product\\ndevelopment, our businesses invest together in\\ncollaborative research activities covering topics\\nsuch as artificial intelligence, software, sensors,\\ncontrol and optimization, mechatronics and\\nrobotics, power electronics, communication\\ntechnologies, material and manufacturing, elec-\\ntrodynamics and electrical switching\\ntechnologies. This results in advancing the\\nstate-of-the-art technologies used in our prod-\\nucts and in common technology platforms that\\ncan be applied in multiple product lines.\\nUniversities are incubators of future technology,\\nand one task of our research and development\\nteams is to transform university research into\\nindustry-ready technology platforms. We collabo-\\nrate with multiple universities and research\\ninstitutions to build research networks and foster\\nnew technologies. We believe these collaborations\\nshorten the amount of time required to turn basic\\nideas into viable products, and they additionally\\nhelp us to recruit and train new personnel. We\\nhave built numerous university collaborations in\\nseveral continents, including long-term, strategic\\nrelationships with a number of leading institu-\\ntions in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Sweden,\\nGermany, Switzerland, Poland, India and China.\\nWe are also leveraging our ecosystem to enhance\\nour innovation efforts and gain speed with strate-\\ngic partners with complementary competencies.\\nIn addition, we invest and collaborate with\\nstart-ups worldwide via our corporate venture\\narm ABB Technology Ventures and our start-up\\ncollaboration arm SynerLeap.\\nThe result of our investment in research and\\ndevelopment is that ABB is widely recognized for\\nits world-class technology. Technology has been\\ndeeply embedded in our DNA since our founding\\nand has carried us through our century-long\\nhistory. It is one of the main reasons why custom-\\ners and partners turn to us for help on their\\nbiggest challenges.

ASTI, headquartered in\\nBurgos, Spain, is a global autonomous mobile\\nrobot (AMR) manufacturer and employs approxi-\\nmately 300 people. See \"Note 4 - Acquisitions,\\ndivestments and equity-accounted companies\" to\\nour Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nThere were no significant acquisitions in 2020 or\\n2019.\\n## Divestments\\nDivestment of Mechanical Power Transmission\\nDivision\\nIn November 2021, we completed the sale of our\\nMechanical Power Transmission Division (Dodge)\\nto RBC Bearings Inc. for cash proceeds of\\n$2,862 million, net of transactions costs and cash\\ndisposed and recognizing a net gain on sale of\\n$2,195 million. Prior to its disposal, the Dodge\\nbusiness was part of our Motion operating\\nsegment. See \"Note 4 - Acquisitions, divestments\\nand equity-accounted companies\" to our Consoli-\\ndated Financial Statements.\\n### Divestment of Power Grids\\nOn July 1, 2020, ABB completed the divestment of\\n80.1 percent of its former Power Grids business to\\nHitachi. As this divestment represented a strate-\\ngic shift that had a major effect on our operations\\nand financial results, the results of operations for\\nthis business are presented as discontinued\\noperations and the assets and liabilities are\\nreflected as held for sale for all periods presented.\\nFor more information on the divestment of the\\nPower Grids business see \"Note 3 - Discontinued\\noperations\" to our Consolidated Financial\\nStatements.\\n### Divestment of solar inverters\\nIn February 2020, ABB completed the sale of its\\nsolar inverters business to FIMER S.p.A. (Italy) for\\nno consideration. Under the agreement, which\\nwas reached in July 2019, ABB was obligated to\\ntransfer $143 million of cash to the buyer on the\\nclosing date. In addition, further payments total-\\ning EUR 132 million ($145 million at the divestment\\ndate) are required to be transferred to the buyer\\nfrom 2020 through 2025. In connection with this\\ndivestment, in 2019, we recorded a loss of\\n$421 million, representing the excess of the\\ncarrying value over the estimated fair value of this\\nbusiness. In 2020, a further $33 million was\\nrecorded for additional changes in fair value\\noccurring prior to the date of sale. Both amounts,\\nin the respective years are reported in \"Other\\nincome (expense), net\". See \"Note 4 - Acquisitions,\\ndivestments and equity-accounted companies\" to\\nour Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n### Other\\nIn 2019, we recorded net gains (including transac-\\ntion costs) of $55 million, primarily due to the\\ndivestment of two businesses in China.\\n—\\n## Exchange rates\\nWe report our financial results in U.S. dollars. Due\\nto our global operations, a significant amount of\\nour revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are\\ndenominated in other currencies. As a conse-\\nquence, movements in exchange rates between\\ncurrencies may affect: (i) our profitability, (ii) the\\ncomparability of our results between periods and\\n(iii) the reported carrying value of our assets and\\nliabilities.\\nWe translate non-USD denominated results of\\noperations, assets and liabilities to USD in our\\nConsolidated Financial Statements.

We measure period-to-period\\nvariations in local currency results by using a\\nconstant foreign exchange rate for all periods\\nunder comparison. Differences in our results of\\noperations in local currencies as compared to our\\nresults of operations in USD are caused exclu-\\nsively by changes in currency exchange rates.\\nWhile we consider our results of operations as\\nmeasured in local currencies to be a significant\\nindicator of business performance, local currency\\ninformation should not be relied upon to the\\nexclusion of U.S. GAAP financial measures. In-\\nstead, local currencies reflect an additional\\nmeasure of comparability and provide a means of\\nviewing aspects of our operations that, when\\nviewed together with the U.S. GAAP results,\\nprovide a more complete understanding of fac-\\ntors and trends affecting the business. As local\\ncurrency information is not standardized, it may\\nnot be possible to compare our local currency\\ninformation to other companies\\' financial mea-\\nsures that have the same or a similar title.

       " '\\n\\n\\n—\\n### Orders\\nOur policy is to book and report an order\\nwhen a binding contractual agreement has been\\nconcluded with a customer covering, at a mini-\\nmum, the price and scope of products or services\\nto be supplied, the delivery schedule and the\\npayment terms. The reported value of an order\\ncorresponds to the undiscounted value of reve-\\nnues that we expect to recognize following\\ndelivery of the goods or services subject to the\\norder, less any trade discounts and excluding any\\nvalue added or sales tax. The value of orders\\nreceived during a given period of time represents\\nthe sum of the value of all orders received during\\nthe period, adjusted to reflect the aggregate\\nvalue of any changes to the value of orders re-\\nceived during the period and orders existing at\\nthe beginning of the period. These adjustments,\\nwhich may in the aggregate increase or decrease\\nthe orders reported during the period, may\\ninclude changes in the estimated order price up to\\nthe date of contractual performance, changes in\\nthe scope of products or services ordered and\\ncancellations of orders.

In the Americas\\nrevenues increased 9 percent (9 percent in local\\ncurrencies) and were higher across all Business\\nAreas. Revenues increased in the U.S., Canada,\\nBrazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile while they\\ndecreased slightly in Peru and Panama. In Europe\\nrevenues increased 8 percent (5 percent in local\\ncurrencies) and increased across all Business\\nAreas except the Process Automation Business\\nArea. Sales were lower in Finland and France while\\nrevenues grew in Germany, the United Kingdom,\\nItaly, Sweden, Turkey, Austria, Netherlands and\\nSwitzerland. In Asia, Middle East and Africa reve-\\nnues increased 16 percent (11 percent in local\\ncurrencies) and increased across all Business\\nAreas. Revenues increased in China, India, Austra-\\nlia and South Korea while they decreased in Japan.\\n## Cost of sales\\nCost of sales consists primarily of labor, raw\\nmaterials and component costs but also includes\\nindirect production costs, expenses for warran-\\nties, contract and project charges, as well as\\norder-related development expenses incurred in\\nconnection with projects for which corresponding\\nrevenues have been recognized.\\nIn 2021, cost of sales increased 7 percent (4 per-\\ncent in local currencies) to $19,478 million. Cost of\\nsales as a percentage of revenues decreased to\\n67.3 percent from 69.9 percent in 2020, an\\nincrease in the gross margin of 2.6 percent,\\nprimarily driven by lower losses in non-core\\nbusinesses, and because 2020 included signifi-\\ncant warranty charges related to a divested\\nbusiness as well as losses on specific projects.\\nThe increase in gross margin also reflects higher\\nrevenue volumes, a positive portfolio mix as well\\nas price increases and certain cost savings ac-\\ntions taken to mitigate higher commodity prices\\nand freight costs. In 2021, gross margin percent-\\nages were higher in the Electrification, Robotics &\\nDiscrete Automation and Process Automation\\nBusiness Areas. The gross margin percentage in\\nthe Motion Business Area was lower in 2021\\ncompared to 2020 due to the impact of higher\\ncommodity prices. For ABB, the gross margin did\\nbenefit partially from the results of saving initia-\\ntives in the areas of supply chain and operational\\nexcellence.\\n## Selling, general and\\nadministrative expenses\\nThe components of selling, general and adminis-\\ntrative expenses were as follows:\\n($ in millions)\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nSelling expenses\\n3,281\\n3,087\\n3,383\\nGeneral and administrative\\nexpenses\\n1,881\\n1,808\\n2,064\\nTotal\\n5,162\\n4,895\\n5,447\\nIn 2021, general and administrative expenses\\nincreased 4 percent (1 percent in local currencies)\\ncompared to 2020.

Stranded costs were\\noverhead and other management costs which\\ncould previously be allocated to the Power Grids\\nbusiness.\\nIn 2021, selling expenses increased 6 percent\\n(3 percent in local currencies) compared to 2020\\nacross all Business Areas as pandemic-related\\nrestrictions were gradually relaxed and we in-\\ncreased sales activities to keep pace with the\\nstrong recovery in demand. Selling expenses\\nas a percentage of orders received decreased\\nfrom 11.6 percent in 2020 to 10.3 percent in 2021\\nmainly due to strong order growth.\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n## Non-order related research and\\ndevelopment expenses\\nIn 2021, non-order related research and develop-\\nment expenses increased 8 percent (4 percent in\\nlocal currencies) compared to 2020. Non-order\\nrelated research and development expenses\\nincreased mainly due to higher investment activi-\\nties related to selective growth areas in certain\\noperating Divisions such as Distribution Solu-\\ntions, Robotics, Process Industries, Smart\\nBuildings and E-mobility.\\nIn 2021, the higher non-order related research and\\ndevelopment expenses were consistent with the\\nhigher revenues and as a percentage of revenues\\nthese expenditures decreased in 2021 to 4.2 per-\\ncent from 4.3 percent compared to the\\nprevious year.\\n## Impairment of goodwill\\nIn 2020, as a result of the new composition of the\\nreporting units and reallocation of goodwill, we\\nrecorded an impairment charge of $311 million,\\nthe majority of which related to our Machine\\nAutomation Division within the Robotics & Dis-\\ncrete Automation Business Area.

In 2021, we recorded gains of $2,193 mil-\\nlion in Other income (expense), net for net gains\\nfrom sales of businesses. This is primarily due to\\nthe divestment of the Dodge business. In 2021, we\\nalso recorded a full year of both brand income and\\nincome for provision of transition services relat-\\ning to Hitachi Energy, compared to only six\\nmonths of income in 2020. In 2021, we recorded\\nhigher increases in the fair value of various equity\\ninvestments in our ABB Technology Ventures\\nportfolio, the most significant of which related to\\nCMR Surgical Ltd. The amount in 2021 also reflects\\nlower restructuring and restructuring-related\\nexpenses and lower asset impairments.

These transactions\\nresulted in losses on extinguishment of debt in\\n2020 totaling $162 million (see \"Note 12 - Debt\" to\\nour Consolidated Financial Statements). The\\nreduction of outstanding debt from these public\\ntenders as well as maturities of bonds in both\\n2021 and 2020 reduced \"Interest and other fi-\\nnance expense\" by approximately $70 million\\ncompared to 2020. This was partially offset by\\nhigher interest expense for income tax related\\ncontingencies and the elimination of the alloca-\\ntion of interest expense to discontinued\\noperations subsequent to the divestment of the\\nPower Grids business.\\n## Non-operational pension (cost)\\ncredit\\nA non-operational pension credit of $166 million\\nwas recorded in 2021 compared to a $401 million\\ncost in 2020. Non-operational pension credits\\nprimarily result from higher expected returns on\\nplan assets compared to interest costs on benefit\\nobligations.

In 2020, the income tax rate was\\nhigher by 9 percent due to the impairment of\\nnon-deductible goodwill, 10 percent due to\\nnon-deductible charges relating to the settlement\\nof certain defined benefit pension plans and\\n5 percent due to losses from extinguishment of\\ndebt which were incurred in jurisdictions\\nwith a full valuation allowance. In 2021, the tax\\nimpacts related to the sale of the Dodge business\\nreduced the effective tax rate by approximately\\n5 percent. We also realized certain benefits from\\ninternal reorganizations in anticipation of this\\ndivestment which reduced the effective tax rate\\nby a further 4 percent.\\nSee \"Note 16 - Income taxes\" to our Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements for additional information.\\n## Income from continuing\\noperations, net of tax\\nAs a result of the factors discussed above,\\ncompared to 2020, Income from continuing\\noperations, net of tax, increased by $4,385 million\\nto $4,730 million in 2021.\\n## Income from discontinued\\noperations, net of tax\\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net\\nof tax, in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\\n($ millions)\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nTotal revenues\\n—\\n4,008\\n9,037\\nTotal cost of sales\\n—\\n(3,058) (6,983)\\nGross profit\\n—\\n950\\n2,054\\nExpenses\\n(18)\\n(808) (1,394)\\nChange to net gain recognized\\non sale of the Power Grids\\nbusiness\\n(65)\\n5,141\\n—\\nIncome (loss) from operations\\n(83)\\n5,282\\n660\\nNet interest income (expense)\\nand other finance expense\\n2\\n(5)\\n(61)\\nNon-operational pension (cost)\\ncredit\\n—\\n(94)\\n5\\nIncome (loss) from discontinued\\noperations before taxes\\n(81)\\n5,182\\n605\\nIncome tax\\n1\\n(322)\\n(167)\\nIncome (loss) from discontinued\\noperations, net of tax\\n(80)\\n4,860\\n438\\nOn July 1, 2020, we completed the divestment of\\n80.1 percent of our former Power Grids business\\nto Hitachi.

       " '\\n\\n\\n### Order backlog\\nIn 2021, the order backlog increased 25 percent\\n(29 percent in local currencies). The order backlog\\nbenefited from the strong order intake, but also\\nreflected execution challenges caused by material\\nshortages, transportation constraints as well as\\npandemic-related production pressures in some\\nlocal markets.\\n## Revenues\\nIn 2021, revenues increased 11 percent (8 percent\\nin local currencies). Revenues increased in all\\nDivisions reflecting widespread market recovery\\nacross all regions, however growth was hampered\\nby component shortage and logistic challenges,\\nparticularly for the project business. Revenue\\ngrowth in short-cycle businesses was higher than\\nin long-cycle businesses, reflecting some cus-\\ntomer stockpiling. Pricing actions taken to\\nmitigate increasing material and transportation\\ncosts also contributed to the higher revenue level.\\nThe revenue growth rate was led by the E-mobility\\nDivision mirroring the very high demand in this\\nsegment. There was also double-digit revenue\\ngrowth in the Installation Products Division\\nreflecting demand recovery in the U.S. and\\nCanada, as well as in the Smart Power Division.\\nRevenue growth was solid for the Smart Buildings\\nDivision, whereas revenues grew more modestly\\nfor the Distribution Solutions and Power Conver-\\nsion Divisions.\\nThe geographic distribution of revenues for our\\nElectrification Business Area was as follows:\\n($ in millions)\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nEurope\\n4,628\\n4,190\\n4,251\\nThe Americas\\n4,503\\n4,093\\n4,635\\nof which: United States\\n3,322\\n3,115\\n3,555\\nAsia, Middle East and Africa\\n4,056\\n3,641\\n3,842\\nof which: China\\n2,110\\n1,858\\n1,749\\nTotal\\n13,187\\n11,924 12,728\\nIn 2021, revenues in the Americas increased\\n10 percent (9 percent in local currencies) led\\nby a strong recovery in Canada and Mexico, while\\nrevenues in the U.S. recorded high single-digit\\ngrowth. Revenues increased 11 percent (7 percent\\nin local currencies) in Asia, Middle East and Africa,\\ndriven by growth in China and India. Revenues in\\nEurope increased 10 percent (8 percent in local\\ncurrencies) reflecting widespread growth across\\nthe region, including key markets such as Ger-\\nmany and Italy.\\n### Income from operations\\nIn 2021, income from operations increased 38 per-\\ncent, supported by higher revenues. Pricing\\nactions across the product businesses and the\\nbenefits of savings realized from ongoing restruc-\\nturing and cost savings programs also positively\\ninfluenced the income from operations. Restruc-\\nturing related expenses and implementation\\ncosts in our operating Divisions were lower in\\n2021 than in 2020, mainly as the integration of\\nGEIS is nearing completion. These positives were\\npartially dampened by higher commodity prices\\nin 2021, as well as increased costs for transporta-\\ntion and logistics. The income from operations\\nwas burdened by higher personnel expenses\\ndriven by a ramp-up of manufacturing capacity to\\nmeet higher demand. There was also negative\\ncomparable impact from the discontinuance of\\nvarious pandemic-related government support\\nprograms that were more significant in 2020\\ncompared to 2021. Changes in foreign currencies,\\nincluding the impacts from FX/commodity timing\\ndifferences summarized in the table below, posi-\\ntively impacted the income from operations by\\napproximately 1 percentage point.\\n#### Operational EBITA\\nThe reconciliation of Income from operations to\\nOperational EBITA for the Electrification Business\\nArea was as follows:\\n($ in millions)\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nIncome from operations\\n1,841\\n1,335\\n1,049\\nAcquisition-related amortization\\n117\\n115\\n115\\nRestructuring, related and\\nimplementation costs\\n66\\n145\\n112\\nChanges in obligations related to\\ndivested businesses\\n—\\n15\\n—\\nChanges in pre-acquisition\\nestimates\\n(6)\\n11\\n22\\nGains and losses from sale of\\nbusinesses\\n13\\n4\\n(42)\\nFair value adjustment on assets\\nand liabilities held for sale\\n—\\n33\\n421\\nFavorable resolution of an\\nuncertain purchase price\\nadjustment\\n(5)\\n(36)\\n(92)\\nAcquisition- and divestment-\\nrelated expenses and integration\\ncosts\\n70\\n71\\n119\\nCertain other non-operational\\nitems\\n—\\n9\\n3\\nFX/commodity timing\\ndifferences in income from\\noperations\\n25\\n(21)\\n(19)\\nOperational EBITA\\n2,121\\n1,681\\n1,688\\nIn 2021, Operational EBITA increased 26 percent\\n(20 percent excluding the impact from changes in\\nforeign currency exchange rates) compared to\\n2020, primarily due to the reasons described\\nunder \"Income from operations\", excluding the\\nexplanations related to the reconciling items in\\nthe table above.',\n",

Revenues\\nincreased in both Divisions due to higher volumes\\nfrom book-and-bill business, however growth was\\nhampered by component shortages (primarily\\nrelated to semiconductors), logistic challenges\\nwhich triggered longer lead times for some\\ncustomer deliveries and a tight labor market.\\nService revenues also increased, driven by strong\\ndemand from all industry segments but especially\\nfrom general industry.\\nThe geographic distribution of revenues for our\\nRobotics & Discrete Automation Business Area\\nwas as follows:\\n($ in millions)\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nEurope\\n1,582\\n1,481\\n1,680\\nThe Americas\\n441\\n389\\n464\\nof which: United States\\n309\\n273\\n293\\nAsia, Middle East and Africa\\n1,274\\n1,037\\n1,170\\nof which: China\\n950\\n719\\n829\\nTotal\\n3,297\\n2,907\\n3,314\\nIn 2021, revenues increased in all regions. The\\nrevenues from Asia, Middle East and Africa in-\\ncreased 23 percent (17 percent in local currencies)\\ncompared to 2020 due to higher book-and-bill\\nrevenues and a higher level of execution of auto-\\nmotive segment orders, particularly in China.\\nRevenues in Europe increased 7 percent (4 percent\\nin local currencies) with Austria and Spain per-\\nforming strongly while revenues declined in the\\nUnited Kingdom and France. In the Americas,\\nrevenues increased 13 percent (12 percent in local\\ncurrencies) due to strong demand in the U.S. in\\nboth Divisions after recovery from the low levels\\nin 2020.\\n## Income (loss) from operations\\nIn 2021, the Business Area recorded income from\\noperations of $269 million compared to a loss of\\n$163 million in 2020, as the improvement in under-\\nlying operating performance in 2020 was more\\nthan offset by the $290 million impairment of\\ngoodwill recorded in the Machine Automation\\nDivision in 2020. The operational performance in\\n2021 reflected improved sales volumes, a favor-\\nable change in the revenue mix and the benefit of\\ncost reduction measures taken in 2020. Changes\\nin foreign currencies, including the impacts from\\nFX/commodity timing differences summarized in\\nthe table below, positively impacted the income\\nfrom operations by approximately 6 percent.\\n## Operational EBITA\\nThe reconciliation of Income (loss) from opera-\\ntions to Operational EBITA for the Robotics &\\nDiscrete Automation Business Area was as\\nfollows:\\n($ in millions)\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nIncome (loss) from operations\\n269\\n(163)\\n298\\nAcquisition-related amortization\\n83\\n78\\n77\\nRestructuring, related and\\nimplementation costs\\n7\\n26\\n12\\nAcquisition- and divestment-\\nrelated expenses and integration\\ncosts\\n1\\n—\\n1\\nImpairment of goodwill\\n—\\n290\\n—\\nCertain other non-operational\\nitems\\n—\\n5\\n4\\nFX/commodity timing\\ndifferences in income from\\noperations\\n(5\\n1\\n1\\nOperational EBITA\\n355\\n237\\n393\\nIn 2021, Operational EBITA increased 50 percent\\n(41 percent excluding the impact from changes in\\nforeign currency exchange rates) compared to\\n2020, primarily due to the reasons described\\nunder \"Income (loss) from operations\", excluding\\nthe explanations related to the reconciling items\\nin the table above.',\n",

We\\nactively monitor credit risk in our investment\\nportfolio and derivative portfolio. Credit risk\\nexposures are controlled in accordance with\\npolicies approved by our senior management to\\nidentify, measure, monitor and control credit\\nrisks. We have minimum rating requirements for\\nour counterparts and closely monitor develop-\\nments in the credit markets making appropriate\\nchanges to our investment policy as deemed\\nnecessary.

In our opinion the Group\\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021,\\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with Swiss law, Swiss Auditing Standards and the standards of the Public\\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Group as\\nof December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated income statements, statements of comprehensive\\nincome, cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended\\nDecember 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated\\nFebruary 24, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\\n### Basis for Opinion\\nThe Group's Board of Directors and management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over\\nfinancial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in\\nthe accompanying Report of management on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express\\nan opinion on the Group's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting\\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Group in accordance with\\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\\naudit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's\\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\",\n",
       " '\\nKPMG\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\\ndeteriorate.\\nKPMG AG\\nHans-Dieter Krauss\\nLicensed Audit Expert\\nAuditor in Charge\\nZurich, Switzerland\\nFebruary 24, 2022\\nMohammad Nafeie\\nKPMG AG, Badenerstrasse 172, PO Box, CH-8036 Zurich\\n<!-- Footnote=\"@ 2022 KPMG AG, a Swiss corporation, is a subsidiary of KPMG Holding AG, which is a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member\\nfirms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Investments in joint ventures and affiliated companies in which the Company has the\\nability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally through direct or\\nindirect ownership of 20 percent to 50 percent of the voting rights), are recorded in the Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements using the equity method of accounting.\\n### Translation of foreign currencies and foreign exchange transactions\\nThe functional currency for most of the Company\\'s subsidiaries is the applicable local currency. The\\ntranslation from the applicable functional currencies into the Company\\'s reporting currency is\\nperformed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for\\nincome statement accounts using average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The resulting\\ntranslation adjustments are excluded from the determination of earnings and are recognized in\\n\"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" until the subsidiary is sold, substantially liquidated or\\nevaluated for impairment in anticipation of disposal.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses, such as those resulting from foreign currency\\ndenominated receivables or payables, are included in the determination of earnings, except as they\\nrelate to intercompany loans that are equity-like in nature with no reasonable expectation of repayment,\\nwhich are recognized in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\". Exchange gains and losses recognized\\nin earnings are included in \"Total revenues\", \"Total cost of sales\", \"Selling, general and administrative\\nexpenses\" or \"Interest and other finance expense\" consistent with the nature of the underlying item.\\n#### Discontinued operations\\nThe Company reports a disposal, or planned disposal, of a component or a group of components\\nas a discontinued operation if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major\\neffect on the Company\\'s operations and financial results. A strategic shift could include a disposal\\nof a major geographical area, a major line of business or other major parts of the\\nCompany. A component may be a reportable segment or an operating segment, a reporting\\nunit, a subsidiary, or an asset group.\\nThe assets and liabilities of a component reported as a discontinued operation are presented\\nseparately as held for sale and in discontinued operations in the Company\\'s Consolidated\\nBalance Sheets.\\nInterest expense that is not directly attributable to or related to the Company\\'s continuing business or\\ndiscontinued business is allocated to discontinued operations based on the ratio of net assets to be\\nsold less debt that is required to be paid as a result of the planned disposal transaction to the sum of\\ntotal net assets of the Company plus consolidated debt. General corporate overhead is not allocated to\\ndiscontinued operations (see Note 3).\\n#### Operating cycle\\nA portion of the Company\\'s activities (primarily long-term system integration activities) has an\\noperating cycle that exceeds one year. For classification of current assets and liabilities related to such\\nactivities, the Company elected to use the duration of the individual contracts as its operating cycle.\\nAccordingly, there are accounts receivable, inventories and provisions related to these contracts which\\nwill not be realized within one year that have been classified as current.\\n#### Use of estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\\nassumptions and estimates that directly affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial\\nStatements and the accompanying Notes. These accounting assumptions and estimates include:\\n· growth rates, discount rates and other assumptions used to determine impairment of long-lived\\nassets and in testing goodwill for impairment,\\n. estimates to determine valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and amounts recorded for\\nunrecognized tax benefits,\\n· assumptions used in determining inventory obsolescence and net realizable value,\\n. estimates and assumptions used in determining the initial fair value of retained noncontrolling\\ninterest and certain obligations in connection with divestments,\\n· estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities assumed in\\nbusiness combinations,\\n· assumptions used in the determination of corporate costs directly attributable to\\ndiscontinued operations,\\n· estimates of loss contingencies associated with litigation or threatened litigation and other claims\\nand inquiries, environmental damages, product warranties, self-insurance reserves, regulatory and\\nother proceedings,\\n· estimates used to record expected costs for employee severance in connection with\\nrestructuring programs,\\n. estimates related to credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of financial assets such as\\ntrade and other receivables, loans and other instruments,\\n· assumptions used in the calculation of pension and postretirement benefits and the fair value of\\npension plan assets, and',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n· assumptions and projections, principally related to future material, labor and project-related\\noverhead costs, used in determining the percentage-of-completion on projects where revenue is\\nrecognized over time, as well as the amount of variable consideration the Company expects to be\\nentitled to.\\nThe actual results and outcomes may differ from the Company\\'s estimates and assumptions.\\n##### Cash and equivalents\\nCash and equivalents include highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the\\ndate of acquisition.\\nCurrency and other local regulatory limitations related to the transfer of funds exist in a number of\\ncountries where the Company operates. Funds, other than regular dividends, fees or loan repayments,\\ncannot be readily transferred abroad from these countries and are therefore deposited and used for\\nworking capital needs locally. These funds are included in cash and equivalents as they are not\\nconsidered restricted.\\nCash and equivalents that are subject to contractual restrictions or other legal obligations and are not\\nreadily available are classified as \"Restricted cash\".\\n## Marketable securities and short-term investments\\nManagement determines the appropriate classification of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt\\nsecurities at the time of purchase. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company\\nhas the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity debt securities\\nare carried at amortized cost, adjusted for accretion of discounts or amortization of premiums to\\nmaturity computed under the effective interest method. Such accretion or amortization is included in\\n\"Interest and dividend income\". Marketable debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity are\\nclassified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value.\\nUnrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are excluded from the determination of\\nearnings and are instead recognized in the \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" component of\\nstockholders\\' equity, net of tax, until realized. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt\\nsecurities are computed based upon the historical cost of these securities, using the specific\\nidentification method.\\nMarketable debt securities are classified as either \"Cash and equivalents\" or \"Marketable securities and\\nshort-term investments\" according to their maturity at the time of acquisition.\\nMarketable equity securities are generally classified as \"Marketable securities and short-term\\ninvestments\", however, any marketable securities held as a long-term investment rather than as an\\ninvestment of excess liquidity are classified as \"Other non-current assets\". Equity securities are\\nmeasured at fair value with fair value changes reported in net income. Fair value changes for equity\\nsecurities are generally reported in \"Interest and other finance expense\", however, fair value changes for\\ncertain equity securities classified as long-term investments are reported in \"Other income (expense),\\nnet\".\\nFor debt securities classified as available-for-sale where fair value has declined below amortized cost\\ndue to credit losses, the Company records an allowance for expected credit losses and adjusts the\\nallowance in subsequent periods in \"Interest and other finance expense\". All fair value changes other\\nthan those related to credit risk are reported in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" until the\\nsecurity is sold.\\nIn addition, equity securities without readily determinable fair values are remeasured if there is an\\nobservable price change in an orderly transaction for the same investment, or if a qualitative\\nassessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than\\nits carrying amount. Similar to other fair value changes as described above, depending on the nature of\\nthe investment, this fair value change is either recorded in \"Other income (expense), net\" or \"Interest\\nand other finance expense\".',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n### Accounts receivable and allowance for expected credit losses\\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount. The Company has a group-wide policy on the\\nmanagement of credit risk. The policy includes a credit assessment methodology to assess the\\ncreditworthiness of customers and assign to those customers a risk category. Third-party agencies\\'\\nratings are considered, if available. For customers where agency ratings are not available, the\\ncustomer\\'s most recent financial statements, payment history and other relevant information are\\nconsidered in the assignment to a risk category. Customers are assessed at least annually or more\\nfrequently when information on significant changes in the customer\\'s financial position becomes\\nknown. In addition to the assignment to a risk category, a credit limit per customer is set.\\nThe Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses to present the net amount of receivables\\nexpected to be collected at the balance sheet date. The allowance is based on the credit losses\\nexpected to arise over the asset\\'s contractual term taking into account historical loss experience,\\ncustomer-specific data as well as forward looking estimates. The Company\\'s accounts receivable are\\nfirst grouped by the individual legal entity which generally has a geographic concentration of\\nreceivables, resulting in different risk levels for different entities. Receivables are then further\\nsubdivided within the entity into pools based on similar risk characteristics to estimate expected credit\\nlosses. Expected credit losses are estimated individually when the related assets do not share similar\\nrisk characteristics.\\nAccounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible and are recognized as a deduction from\\nthe allowance for credit losses. Expected recoveries, which are not to exceed the amount previously\\nwritten off, are considered in determining the allowance balance at the balance sheet date.\\nThe Company, in its normal course of business, transfers receivables to third parties, generally without\\nrecourse. The transfer is accounted for as a sale when the Company has surrendered control over the\\nreceivables. Control is deemed to have been surrendered when (i) the transferred receivables have been\\nput presumptively beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other\\nreceivership, (ii) the third-party transferees have the right to pledge or exchange the transferred\\nreceivables, and (iii) the Company has relinquished effective control over the transferred receivables\\nand does not retain the ability or obligation to repurchase or redeem the transferred receivables. At the\\ntime of sale, the sold receivables are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related\\ncash inflows are classified as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Costs\\nassociated with the sale of receivables, including the related gains and losses from the sales, are\\nincluded in \"Interest and other finance expense\". Transfers of receivables that do not meet the\\nrequirements for treatment as sales are accounted for as secured borrowings and the related cash\\nflows are classified as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\\n#### Concentrations of credit risk\\nThe Company sells a broad range of products, systems, services and software to a wide range of\\nindustrial, commercial and utility customers as well as various government agencies and\\nquasi-governmental agencies throughout the world. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to\\naccounts receivable are limited, as the Company\\'s customer base is comprised of a large number of\\nindividual customers. Ongoing credit evaluations of customers\\' financial positions are performed to\\ndetermine whether the use of credit support instruments such as guarantees, letters of credit or credit\\ninsurance are necessary; collateral is not generally required. The Company maintains an allowance for\\ncredit losses as discussed above in \"Accounts receivable and allowance for expected credit losses\". Such\\nlosses, in the aggregate, are in line with the Company\\'s expectations.\\nIt is the Company\\'s policy to invest cash in deposits with banks throughout the world with certain\\nminimum credit ratings and in high quality, low risk, liquid investments. The Company actively manages\\nits credit risk by routinely reviewing the creditworthiness of the banks and the investments held. The\\nCompany has not incurred significant credit losses related to such investments.\\nThe Company\\'s exposure to credit risk on derivative financial instruments is the risk that the\\ncounterparty will fail to meet its obligations. To reduce this risk, the Company has credit policies that\\nrequire the establishment and periodic review of credit limits for individual counterparties. In addition,\\nthe Company has entered into close-out netting agreements with most derivative counterparties.\\nClose-out netting agreements provide for the termination, valuation and net settlement of some or all',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\noutstanding transactions between two counterparties on the occurrence of one or more pre-defined\\ntrigger events. Derivative instruments are presented on a gross basis in the Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements.\\n## Revenue recognition\\nA customer contract exists if collectability under the contract is considered probable, the contract has\\ncommercial substance, contains payment terms, as well as the rights and commitments of both parties,\\nand has been approved.\\nThe Company offers arrangements with multiple performance obligations to meet its customers'\\nneeds. These arrangements may involve the delivery of multiple products and/or performance of\\nservices (such as installation and training) and the delivery and/or performance may occur at different\\npoints in time or over different periods of time. Goods and services under such arrangements are\\nevaluated to determine whether they form distinct performance obligations and should be accounted\\nfor as separate revenue transactions. The Company allocates the sales price to each distinct\\nperformance obligation based on the price of each item sold in separate transactions at the inception\\nof the arrangement.\\nThe Company generally recognizes revenues for the sale of non-customized products including circuit\\nbreakers, modular substation packages, control products, motors, generators, drives, robots,\\nturbochargers, measurement and analytical instrumentation, and other goods which are manufactured\\non a standardized basis at a point in time. Revenues are recognized at the point in time that the\\ncustomer obtains control of the goods, which is when it has taken title to the products and assumed\\nthe risks and rewards of ownership of the products specified in the purchase order or sales agreement.\\nGenerally, the transfer of title and risks and rewards of ownership are governed by the contractually\\ndefined shipping terms. The Company uses various International Commercial Terms (as promulgated by\\nthe International Chamber of Commerce) in its sales of products to third party customers, such as Ex\\nWorks (EXW), Free Carrier (FCA) and Delivered Duty Paid (DDP).\\nBilling terms for these point in time contracts vary but generally coincide with delivery to the customer.\\nPayment is generally due upon receipt of the invoice, payable within 90 days or less.\\nThe Company generally recognizes revenues for the sale of customized products, including integrated\\nautomation and electrification systems and solutions, on an over time basis using the\\npercentage-of-completion method of accounting. These systems are generally accounted for as a single\\nperformance obligation as the Company is required to integrate equipment and services into one\\ndeliverable for the customer. Revenues are recognized as the systems are customized during the\\nmanufacturing or integration process and as control is transferred to the customer as evidenced by the\\nCompany's right to payment for work performed or by the customer's ownership of the work in process.\\nThe Company principally uses the cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion on\\ncontracts. Under this method, progress of contracts is measured by actual costs incurred in relation to\\nthe Company's best estimate of total costs based on the Company's history of manufacturing or\\nconstructing similar assets for customers. Estimated costs are reviewed and updated routinely for\\ncontracts in progress to reflect changes in quantity or pricing of the inputs. The cumulative effect of\\nany change in estimate is recorded in the period when the change in estimate is determined. Contract\\ncosts include all direct materials, labor and subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract\\nperformance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools and depreciation costs.\\nThe nature of the Company's contracts for the sale of customized products gives rise to several types of\\nvariable consideration, including claims, unpriced change orders, liquidated damages and penalties.\\nThese amounts are estimated based upon the most likely amount of consideration to which the\\ncustomer or the Company will be entitled. The estimated amounts are included in the sales price to the\\nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur when\\nthe uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. All estimates of variable\\nconsideration are reassessed periodically. Back charges to suppliers or subcontractors are recognized\\nas a reduction of cost when it is determined that recovery of such cost is probable and the amounts can\\nbe reliably estimated.\\nBilling terms for these over-time contracts vary but are generally based on achieving specified\\nmilestones. The differences between the timing of revenues recognized and customer billings result in\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\nchanges to contract assets and contract liabilities. Payment is generally due upon receipt of the invoice,\\npayable within 90 days or less. Contractual retention amounts billed to customers are generally due\\nupon expiration of the contractual warranty period.\\nService revenues reflect revenues earned from the Company's activities in providing services to\\ncustomers primarily subsequent to the sale and delivery of a product or complete system. Such\\nrevenues consist of maintenance type contracts, repair services, equipment upgrades, field service\\nactivities that include personnel and accompanying spare parts, training, and installation and\\ncommissioning of products as a stand-alone service or as part of a service contract. The Company\\ngenerally recognizes revenues from service transactions as services are performed or at the point in\\ntime that the customer obtains control of the spare parts. For long-term service contracts including\\nmonitoring and maintenance services, revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of\\nthe contract consistent with the nature, timing and extent of the services or, if the performance pattern\\nis other than straight line, as the services are provided based on costs incurred relative to total\\nexpected costs.\\nIn limited circumstances the Company sells extended warranties that extend the warranty coverage\\nbeyond the standard coverage offered on specific products. Revenues for these warranties are\\nrecorded over the length of the warranty period based on their stand-alone selling price.\\nBilling terms for service contracts vary but are generally based on the occurrence of a service event.\\nPayment is generally due upon receipt of the invoice, payable within 90 days or less.\\nRevenues are reported net of customer rebates, early settlement discounts, and similar incentives.\\nRebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. The most\\ncommon incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined\\nvolume levels.\\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on revenue-producing\\ntransactions between the Company and its customers, such as sales, use, value added and some excise\\ntaxes, are excluded from revenues.\\nThe Company does not adjust the contract price for the effects of a financing component if the\\nCompany expects, at contract inception, that the time between control transfer and cash receipt is less\\nthan 12 months.\\nSales commissions are expensed immediately when the amortization period for the costs to obtain the\\ncontract is less than a year.\\n## Contract loss provisions\\nLosses on contracts are recognized in the period when they are identified and are based upon the\\nanticipated excess of contract costs over the related contract revenues.\\n### Shipping and handling costs\\nShipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of cost of sales.\\n### Inventories\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in,\\nfirst-out method, the weighted-average cost method, or the specific identification method. Inventoried\\ncosts are stated at acquisition cost or actual production cost, including direct material and labor and\\napplicable manufacturing overheads. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable\\nvalue are made, if required, for decreases in sales prices, obsolescence or similar reductions in value.\\n#### Impairment of long-lived assets\\nLong-lived assets that are held and used are evaluated for impairment for each of the Company's asset\\ngroups when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset\\ngroup may not be recoverable. If the asset group's net carrying value exceeds the asset group's net\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\nundiscounted cash flows expected to be generated over its remaining useful life including net proceeds\\nexpected from disposition of the asset group, if any, the carrying amount of the asset group is reduced\\nto its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is determined using a market, income and/or\\ncost approach.\\n## Property, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated using\\nthe straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of the assets are generally as follows:\\n· factories and office buildings: 30 to 40 years,\\n· other facilities: 15 years,\\n· machinery and equipment: 3 to 15 years,\\n· furniture and office equipment: 3 to 8 years, and\\n· leasehold improvements are depreciated over their estimated useful life or, for operating leases, over\\nthe lease term, if shorter.\\n## Goodwill and intangible assets\\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently if events or\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating\\nsegment or one level below an operating segment. For the annual impairment reviews performed in\\n2021 and 2020, respectively, the reporting units were determined to be one level below the\\noperating segments.\\nWhen evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company uses either a qualitative or quantitative\\nassessment method for each reporting unit. The qualitative assessment involves determining, based on\\nan evaluation of qualitative factors, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is\\nless than its carrying value. If, based on this qualitative assessment, it is determined to be more likely\\nthan not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, a quantitative impairment test\\nis performed, otherwise no further analysis is required. If the Company elects not to perform the\\nqualitative assessment for a reporting unit, then a quantitative impairment test is performed.\\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment test, the Company calculates the fair value of a reporting\\nunit using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows, applying a discount rate\\nthat represents the reporting unit's weighted-average cost of capital, and compares it to the reporting\\nunit's carrying value. If the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of\\nthe reporting unit then the Company records an impairment charge equal to the difference, provided\\nthat the loss recognized does not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\\nThe cost of acquired intangible assets with a finite life is amortized using a method of amortization\\nthat reflects the pattern of intangible assets' expected contributions to future cash flows. If that\\npattern cannot be reliably determined, the straight-line method is used. The amortization periods range\\nfrom 3 to 5 years for software and from 5 to 20 years for customer-, technology- and marketing-related\\nintangibles. Intangible assets with a finite life are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of certain\\ntriggering events.\\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage currency, commodity, interest rate and\\nequity exposures, arising from its global operating, financing and investing activities (see Note 6).\\nThe Company recognizes all derivatives, other than certain derivatives indexed to the Company's own\\nstock, at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging\\ninstruments are reported at fair value with derivative gains and losses reported through earnings and\\nclassified consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction.\\nIf the derivatives are designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair\\nvalue of the derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nattributable to the risk being hedged through earnings (in the case of a fair value hedge) or recognized\\nin \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" until the hedged item is recognized in earnings (in the case\\nof a cash flow hedge). Where derivative financial instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges\\nof forecasted transactions and such forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring,\\nhedge accounting is discontinued and any derivative gain or loss previously included in \"Accumulated\\nother comprehensive loss\" is reclassified into earnings consistent with the nature of the original\\nforecasted transaction. Gains or losses from derivatives designated as hedging instruments in a fair\\nvalue hedge are reported through earnings and classified consistent with the nature of the underlying\\nhedged transaction.\\nCertain commercial contracts may grant rights to the Company or the counterparties, or contain other\\nprovisions that are considered to be derivatives. Such embedded derivatives are assessed at inception\\nof the contract and depending on their characteristics, accounted for as separate derivative\\ninstruments and shown at their fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in their fair\\nvalue reported in earnings consistent with the nature of the commercial contract to which they relate.\\nDerivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the\\nunderlying item. Cash flows from the settlement of undesignated derivatives used to manage the risks\\nof different underlying items on a net basis are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating\\nactivities\", as the underlying items are primarily operational in nature. Other cash flows on the\\nsettlement of derivatives are recorded within \"Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\".\\n## Leases\\nThe Company leases primarily real estate, vehicles and machinery.\\nThe Company evaluates if a contract contains a lease at inception of the contract. A contract is or\\ncontains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment (an\\nidentified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To determine this, the Company\\nassesses whether, throughout the period of use, it has both the right to obtain substantially all of the\\neconomic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified\\nasset. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with the classification determining the\\npattern of expense recognition in the Consolidated Income Statements. Lease expense for operating\\nleases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense for finance leases is\\nseparated between amortization of right-of-use assets and lease interest expense.\\nIn many cases, the Company\\'s leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can\\nextend up to 5 years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company\\'s discretion. Renewal\\nperiods are included in the expected lease term if they are reasonably certain of being exercised by the\\nCompany. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. None of the Company\\'s\\nlease agreements contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictions or covenants.\\nLong-term leases (leases with terms greater than 12 months) are recorded in the Consolidated Balance\\nSheets at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the minimum lease\\npayments. The present value of the lease payments is determined by using the interest rate implicit in\\nthe lease if available. As most of the Company\\'s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company\\'s\\nincremental borrowing rate is used for most leases and is determined for portfolios of leases based on\\nthe remaining lease term, currency of the lease, and the internal credit rating of the subsidiary which\\nentered into the lease.\\nShort-term leases (leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less and where it is reasonably\\ncertain that the property will not be leased for a term greater than 12 months) are not recorded in the\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The majority\\nof short-term leases relate to real estate and machinery.\\nAssets under operating lease are included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\". Operating lease\\nliabilities are reported both as current and non-current operating lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets\\nrepresent the Company\\'s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities\\nrepresent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nAssets under finance lease are included in \"Property, plant and equipment, net\" while finance lease\\nliabilities are included in \"Long-term debt\" (including \"Current maturities of long-term debt\" as\\napplicable).\\nLease and non-lease components for leases other than real estate are not accounted for separately.\\n### Income taxes\\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method to account for deferred taxes. Under this method,\\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the\\nfinancial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\\nmeasured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are\\nexpected to reverse. The Company records a deferred tax asset when it determines that it is more likely\\nthan not that the deduction will be sustained based upon the deduction\\'s technical merit. Deferred tax\\nassets and liabilities that can be offset against each other are reported on a net basis. A valuation\\nallowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to\\nbe realized.\\nDeferred taxes are provided on unredeemed retained earnings of the Company\\'s subsidiaries. However,\\ndeferred taxes are not provided on such unredeemed retained earnings to the extent it is expected that\\nthe earnings are permanently reinvested. Such earnings may become taxable upon the sale or\\nliquidation of these subsidiaries or upon the remittance of dividends.\\nThe Company operates in numerous tax jurisdictions and, as a result, is regularly subject to audit by tax\\nauthorities. The Company provides for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed more likely than not\\nthat a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred. Contingency provisions are\\nrecorded based on the technical merits of the Company\\'s filing position, considering the applicable tax\\nlaws and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines and are based\\non its evaluations of the facts and circumstances as of the end of each reporting period.\\nThe Company applies a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertainty in income taxes. The\\nfirst step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available\\nevidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including\\nresolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax\\nbenefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate\\nsettlement. Uncertain tax positions that could be settled against existing loss carryforwards or income\\ntax credits are reported net.\\nExpenses related to tax penalties are classified in the Consolidated Income Statements as \"Income tax\\nexpense\" while interest thereon is classified as \"Interest and other finance expense\". Current income tax\\nrelating to certain items is recognized directly in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" and not in\\nearnings. In general, the Company applies the individual items approach when releasing income tax\\neffects from \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\".\\n## Research and development\\nResearch and development costs not related to specific customer orders are generally expensed\\nas incurred.\\n### Earnings per share\\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing income by the weighted-average number of shares\\noutstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing income by the\\nweighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year, assuming that all potentially dilutive\\nsecurities were exercised, if dilutive. Potentially dilutive securities comprise outstanding written call\\noptions, outstanding options and shares granted subject to certain conditions under the Company\\'s\\nshare-based payment arrangements. See further discussion related to earnings per share in Note 20\\nand of potentially dilutive securities in Note 18.',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n\\n#### Share-based payment arrangements\\nThe Company has various share-based payment arrangements for its employees, which are described\\nmore fully in Note 18. Such arrangements are accounted for under the fair value method. For awards\\nthat are equity-settled, total compensation is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the\\naward at that date, and recorded in earnings over the period the employees are required to render\\nservice. For awards that are cash-settled, compensation is initially measured at grant date and\\nsubsequently remeasured at each reporting period, based on the fair value and vesting percentage of\\nthe award at each of those dates, with changes in the liability recorded in earnings.\\n##### Fair value measures\\nThe Company uses fair value measurement principles to record certain financial assets and liabilities\\non a recurring basis and, when necessary, to record certain non-financial assets at fair value\\non a non-recurring basis, as well as to determine fair value disclosures for certain financial instruments\\ncarried at amortized cost in the financial statements. Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair\\nvalue on a recurring basis include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate derivatives, as well as\\ncash-settled call options and available-for-sale securities. Non-financial assets recorded at fair value\\non a non-recurring basis include long-lived assets that are reduced to their estimated fair value due\\nto impairments.\\nFair value is the price that would be received when selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value,\\nthe Company uses various valuation techniques including the market approach (using observable\\nmarket data for identical or similar assets and liabilities), the income approach (discounted cash flow\\nmodels) and the cost approach (using costs a market participant would incur to develop a comparable\\nasset). Inputs used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities are defined by a three-level\\nhierarchy, depending on the nature of those inputs. The Company has categorized its financial assets\\nand liabilities and non-financial assets measured at fair value within this hierarchy based on whether\\nthe inputs to the valuation technique are observable or unobservable. An observable input is based on\\nmarket data obtained from independent sources, while an unobservable input reflects the Company's\\nassumptions about market data.\\nThe levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\\n###### Level 1:\\nValuation inputs consist of quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities\\n(observable quoted prices). Assets and liabilities valued using Level 1 inputs include exchange-traded\\nequity securities, listed derivatives which are actively traded such as commodity futures, interest\\nrate futures and certain actively traded debt securities.\\n## Level 2:\\nValuation inputs consist of observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as actively quoted\\nprices for similar assets, quoted prices in inactive markets and inputs other than quoted prices such\\nas interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, or inputs derived from other observable data by\\ninterpolation, correlation, regression or other means. The adjustments applied to quoted prices or\\nthe inputs used in valuation models may be both observable and unobservable. In these cases, the\\nfair value measurement is classified as Level 2 unless the unobservable portion of the adjustment or\\nthe unobservable input to the valuation model is significant, in which case the fair value\\nmeasurement would be classified as Level 3. Assets and liabilities valued or disclosed using Level 2\\ninputs include investments in certain funds, certain debt securities that are not actively traded,\\ninterest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, commodity swaps, cash-settled call options,\\nforward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange swaps and forward rate agreements, time\\ndeposits, as well as financing receivables and debt.\\nLevel 3:\\nValuation inputs are based on the Company's assumptions of relevant market data (unobservable\\ninput).\\nInvestments in private equity, real estate and collective funds held within the Company's pension plans\\nare generally valued using the net asset value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient for fair value\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nprovided certain criteria are met. The NAVs are determined based on the fair values of the underlying\\ninvestments in the funds. These assets are not classified in the fair value hierarchy but are\\nseparately disclosed.\\nWhenever quoted prices involve bid-ask spreads, the Company ordinarily determines fair values based\\non mid-market quotes. However, for the purpose of determining the fair value of cash-settled call\\noptions serving as hedges of the Company\\'s management incentive plan (MIP), bid prices are used.\\nWhen determining fair values based on quoted prices in an active market, the Company considers if the\\nlevel of transaction activity for the financial instrument has significantly decreased, or would not be\\nconsidered orderly. In such cases, the resulting changes in valuation techniques would be disclosed. If\\nthe market is considered disorderly or if quoted prices are not available, the Company is required to use\\nanother valuation technique, such as an income approach.\\nDisclosures about the Company\\'s fair value measurements of assets and liabilities are included in\\nNote 7.\\n### Contingencies\\nThe Company is subject to proceedings, litigation or threatened litigation and other claims and\\ninquiries, related to environmental, labor, product, regulatory, tax (other than income tax) and other\\nmatters, and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these\\nmatters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the provision required, if any,\\nfor these contingencies is made after analysis of each individual issue, often with assistance from both\\ninternal and external legal counsel and technical experts. The required amount of a provision\\nfor a contingency of any type may change in the future due to new developments in the particular\\nmatter, including changes in the approach to its resolution.\\nThe Company records a provision for its contingent obligations when it is probable that a loss will be\\nincurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Any such provision is generally recognized on an\\nundiscounted basis using the Company\\'s best estimate of the amount of loss incurred or at the lower\\nend of an estimated range when a single best estimate is not determinable. In some cases, the\\nCompany may be able to recover a portion of the costs relating to these obligations from insurers or\\nother third parties; however, the Company records such amounts only when it is probable that they will\\nbe collected.\\nThe Company generally provides for anticipated costs for warranties when it delivers the related\\nproducts. Warranty costs include calculated costs arising from imperfections in design, material and\\nworkmanship in the Company\\'s products. The Company makes individual assessments on contracts\\nwith risks resulting from order-specific conditions or guarantees and assessments on an overall,\\nstatistical basis for similar products sold in larger quantities.\\nThe Company may have legal obligations to perform environmental clean-up activities related to land\\nand buildings as a result of the normal operations of its business. In some cases, the timing or the\\nmethod of settlement, or both, are conditional upon a future event that may or may not be within the\\ncontrol of the Company, but the underlying obligation itself is unconditional and certain. The Company\\nrecognizes a provision for these obligations when it is probable that a liability for the clean-up activity\\nhas been incurred and a reasonable estimate of its fair value can be made. In some cases, a portion of\\nthe costs expected to be incurred to settle these matters may be recoverable. An asset is recorded\\nwhen it is probable that such amounts are recoverable. Provisions for environmental obligations are not\\ndiscounted to their present value when the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated.\\n#### Pensions and other postretirement benefits\\nThe Company has a number of defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans and\\ntermination indemnity plans. The Company recognizes an asset for such a plan\\'s overfunded status\\nor a liability for such a plan\\'s underfunded status in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, the\\nCompany measures such a plan\\'s assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end\\nof the year and recognizes the changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur.\\nThose changes are reported in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\".',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nThe Company uses actuarial valuations to determine its pension and postretirement benefit costs and\\ncredits. The amounts calculated depend on a variety of key assumptions, including discount rates and\\nexpected return on plan assets. Current market conditions are considered in selecting\\nthese assumptions.\\nThe Company\\'s various pension plan assets are assigned to their respective levels in the fair value\\nhierarchy in accordance with the valuation principles described in the \"Fair value measures\"\\nsection above.\\nSee Note 17 for further discussion of the Company\\'s employee benefit plans.\\n##### Business combinations\\nThe Company accounts for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations using the\\nacquisition method and records these at their respective fair values. Contingent consideration is\\nrecorded at fair value as an element of purchase price with subsequent adjustments recognized\\nin income.\\nIdentifiable intangibles consist of intellectual property such as trademarks and trade names, customer\\nrelationships, patented and unpatented technology, in-process research and development, order\\nbacklog and capitalized software; these are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Such\\nintangibles are subsequently subject to evaluation for potential impairment if events or circumstances\\nindicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See \"Goodwill and intangible assets\" above.\\nAcquisition-related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred.\\nUpon gaining control of an entity in which an equity method or cost basis investment was held by the\\nCompany, the carrying value of that investment is adjusted to fair value with the related gain or loss\\nrecorded in income.\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and\\nthe tax base of assets and liabilities as well as uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances on\\nacquired deferred tax assets assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated\\nas of the acquisition date based on facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. These\\nestimates are subject to change within the measurement period (a period of up to 12 months after the\\nacquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust the provisional acquisition amounts) with any\\nadjustments to the preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill. Changes in deferred taxes,\\nuncertain tax positions and valuation allowances on acquired deferred tax assets that occur after the\\nmeasurement period are recognized in income.\\n### New accounting pronouncements\\nApplicable for current period\\nSimplifying the accounting for income taxes\\nIn January 2021, the Company adopted a new accounting standard update, which enhances and\\nsimplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance related to intraperiod tax allocations,\\nownership changes in investments and certain aspects of interim period tax accounting. Depending on\\nthe amendment, the adoption was applied on either a retrospective, modified retrospective, or\\nprospective basis. This update does not have a significant impact on the Company\\'s Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements.\\n#### Applicable for future periods\\nFacilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting\\nIn March 2020, an accounting standard update was issued which provides temporary optional\\nexpedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to\\nease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London\\nInterbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. This\\nupdate, along with clarifications outlined in a subsequent update issued in January 2021, can be\\nadopted and applied no later than December 31, 2022, with early adoption permitted.

The update requires contract assets and\\nliabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured at the date of acquisition\\nin accordance with the principles for recognizing revenues from contracts with customers. This update\\nis effective prospectively for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning\\nJanuary 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted in any interim period. The Company does not expect this\\nupdate to have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n##### Disclosures about government assistance\\nIn November 2021, an accounting standard update was issued which requires entities to disclose certain\\ntypes of government assistance. Under the update, the Company is required to annually disclose (i) the\\ntype of the assistance received, including any significant terms and conditions, (ii) its related\\naccounting policy, and (iii) the effect such transactions have on its financial statements.

The transaction was executed through the sale of 80.1 percent of the shares of Hitachi\\nEnergy Ltd, formerly Hitachi ABB Power Grids Ltd (\"Hitachi Energy\"). Cash consideration received at the\\nclosing date was $9,241 million net of cash disposed. Further, for accounting purposes, the 19.9 percent\\nownership interest retained by the Company was deemed to have been both divested and reacquired at\\nits fair value on July 1, 2020. The Company also obtained a put option, exercisable with three-months\\'\\nnotice commencing in April 2023 (to be effective from July 2023), allowing the Company to require\\nHitachi to purchase the remaining interest for fair value, subject to a minimum floor price equivalent\\nto a 10 percent discount compared to the price paid for the initial 80.1 percent. The combined fair value\\nof the retained investment and the related put option, which amounted to $1,779 million, was recorded\\nas an equity-method investment and also accounted for as part of the proceeds for the sale of the\\nentire Power Grids business (see Note 4).\\nIn connection with the divestment, the Company recorded liabilities in discontinued operations for\\nestimated future costs and other cash payments of $487 million for various contractual items relating\\nto the sale of the business, including required future cost reimbursements payable to Hitachi Energy,\\ncosts to be incurred by the Company for the direct benefit of Hitachi Energy and an amount due to\\nHitachi Ltd in connection with the expected purchase price finalization of the closing debt and working\\ncapital balances. In October 2021, the Company and Hitachi concluded an agreement to settle the\\nvarious amounts owing by the Company. The net difference between the agreed amounts and the\\namounts initially estimated by the Company was recorded in 2021 in discontinued operations as an\\nadjustment to \"Net gain recognized on sale of the Power Grids business\" in the table below. During 2021\\nand 2020, total cash payments (including the amounts paid under the settlement agreement) of\\n$364 million and $33 million, respectively, were made in connection with these liabilities.

Included in the calculation of the net gain was a cumulative translation\\nloss relating to the Power Grids business of $420 million which was reclassified from Accumulated other\\ncomprehensive loss (see Note 21). Certain amounts included in the net gain were estimated or\\notherwise subject to change in value and in 2021 the Company recorded adjustments, including the\\nagreed settlement amount referred to above, reducing the total net gain by $65 million.

Under the current\\nterms, the TSAs will continue for up to 3 years, and can only be extended on an exceptional basis for\\nbusiness-critical services for an additional period which is reasonably necessary to avoid a material\\nadverse impact on the business. In 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized within its continuing\\noperations, general and administrative expenses incurred to perform the TSAs, offset by $173 million\\nand $91 million, respectively, in TSA-related income for such services that is reported in Other income\\n(expense), net.\\n### Discontinued operations\\nAs a result of the sale of the Power Grids business, substantially all Power Grids-related assets and\\nliabilities have been sold.

The Company uses derivative instruments to\\nreduce and manage the economic impact of these exposures.\\n### Currency risk\\nDue to the global nature of the Company's operations, many of its subsidiaries are exposed to currency\\nrisk in their operating activities from entering into transactions in currencies other than their functional\\ncurrency. To manage such currency risks, the Company's policies require its subsidiaries to hedge their\\nforeign currency exposures from binding sales and purchase contracts denominated in foreign\\ncurrencies. For forecasted foreign currency denominated sales of standard products and the related\\nforeign currency denominated purchases, the Company's policy is to hedge up to a maximum of\\n100 percent of the forecasted foreign currency denominated exposures, depending on the length of the\\nforecasted exposures. Forecasted exposures greater than 12 months are not hedged. Forward foreign\\nexchange contracts are the main instrument used to protect the Company against the volatility of\\nfuture cash flows (caused by changes in exchange rates) of contracted and forecasted sales and\\npurchases denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, within its treasury operations, the Company\\nprimarily uses foreign exchange swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the currency\\nand timing mismatches arising in its liquidity management activities.\\n## Commodity risk\\nVarious commodity products are used in the Company's manufacturing activities. Consequently it is\\nexposed to volatility in future cash flows arising from changes in commodity prices. To manage the\\nprice risk of commodities, the Company's policies require that its subsidiaries hedge the commodity\\nprice risk exposures from binding contracts, as well as at least 50 percent (up to a maximum of\\n100 percent) of the forecasted commodity exposure over the next 12 months or longer (up\\nto a maximum of 18 months). Primarily swap contracts are used to manage the associated price risks\\nof commodities.\\n### Interest rate risk\\nThe Company has issued bonds at fixed rates. Interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate\\nswaps are used to manage the interest rate and foreign currency risk associated with certain debt and\\ngenerally such swaps are designated as fair value hedges. In addition, from time to time, the Company\\nuses instruments such as interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, bond futures or forward rate\\nagreements to manage interest rate risk arising from the Company's balance sheet structure but does\\nnot designate such instruments as hedges.\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n### Equity risk\\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in the fair value of its warrant appreciation rights (WARs)\\nissued under its MIP (Management Incentive Plan) (see Note 18). A WAR gives its holder the right to\\nreceive cash equal to the market price of an equivalent listed warrant on the date of exercise. To\\neliminate such risk, the Company has purchased cash-settled call options, indexed to the shares of the\\nCompany, which entitle the Company to receive amounts equivalent to its obligations under the\\noutstanding WARs.\\n## Volume of derivative activity\\nIn general, while the Company\\'s primary objective in its use of derivatives is to minimize exposures\\narising from its business, certain derivatives are designated and qualify for hedge accounting\\ntreatment while others either are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting.\\n### Foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives\\nThe gross notional amounts of outstanding foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives (whether\\ndesignated as hedges or not) were as follows:\\nType of derivative ($ in millions)\\nTotal notional amounts\\nat December 31,\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n11,276\\n12,610\\n15,015\\nEmbedded foreign exchange derivatives\\n815\\n1,134\\n924\\nCross-currency interest rate swaps\\n906\\n-\\nInterest rate contracts\\n3,541\\n3,227\\n5,188\\n### Derivative commodity contracts\\nThe Company uses derivatives to hedge its direct or indirect exposure to the movement in the prices of\\ncommodities which are primarily copper, silver and aluminum.

The Company applies cash flow hedge accounting in only limited\\ncases. In these cases, the effective portion of the changes in their fair value is recorded in \"Accumulated\\nother comprehensive loss\" and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same line item and in the\\nsame period as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were\\nno significant amounts recorded for cash flow hedge accounting activities.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n#### Fair value hedges\\nTo reduce its interest rate exposure arising primarily from its debt issuance activities, the Company\\nuses interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps. Where such instruments are\\ndesignated as fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of these instruments, as well as the\\nchanges in the fair value of the risk component of the underlying debt being hedged, are recorded as\\noffsetting gains and losses in \"Interest and other finance expense\".\\nThe effect of derivative instruments, designated and qualifying as fair value hedges, on the\\nConsolidated Income Statements was as follows:\\n($ in millions)\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\nGains (losses) recognized in Interest and other finance expense:\\nInterest rate contracts\\nDesignated as fair value hedges\\n(55)\\n11\\n38\\nHedged item\\n56\\n(11)\\n(38)\\nCross-currency interest rate swaps\\nDesignated as fair value hedges\\n(37)\\nHedged item\\n34\\n-\\n## Derivatives not designated in hedge relationships\\nDerivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or do not qualify as either cash flow or fair\\nvalue hedges are economic hedges used for risk management purposes.

If such quoted market prices are not available, fair\\nvalue is determined using market prices for similar assets or present value techniques, applying an\\nappropriate risk-free interest rate adjusted for non-performance risk. The inputs used in present value\\ntechniques are observable and fall into the Level 2 category.\\n· Derivatives: The fair values of derivative instruments are determined using quoted prices of identical\\ninstruments from an active market, if available (Level 1 inputs). If quoted prices are not available, price\\nquotes for similar instruments, appropriately adjusted, or present value techniques, based on\\navailable market data, or option pricing models are used. Cash-settled call options hedging the\\nCompany\\'s WAR liability are valued based on bid prices of the equivalent listed warrant. The fair values\\nobtained using price quotes for similar instruments or valuation techniques represent a Level 2 input\\nunless significant unobservable inputs are used.\\n#### Non-recurring fair value measures\\nThe Company elects to record private equity investments without readily determinable fair values at\\ncost, less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes. The Company reassesses at each\\nreporting period whether these investments continue to qualify for this treatment. In 2021 and 2020,\\nthe Company recognized, in \"Other income (expense), net\", net fair value gains of $108 million and\\n$73 million, respectively, related to certain of its private equity investments based on observable\\nmarket price changes for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. The fair values were\\ndetermined using Level 2 inputs. The carrying values of these investments at December 31, 2021 and\\n2020 totaled $169 million and $105 million.\\nBased on valuations at July 1, 2020, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $311 million\\nin the third quarter of 2020. The fair value measurements used in the analyses were calculated using the\\nincome approach (discounted cash flow method). The discounted cash flow models were calculated\\nusing unobservable inputs, which classified the fair value measurement as Level 3 (see Note 11 for\\nadditional information including further detailed information related to these charges and significant\\nunobservable inputs).\\nIn June 2019, upon meeting the criteria as held for sale, the Company adjusted the carrying value of the\\nsolar inverters business which was sold in February 2020 (See Note 4 for details).

The accumulated impair-\\nment charges amounted to $278 million and $302 million, respectively, and related to the Robotics & Discrete Automation segment.\\nThe Company adopted a new operating model on July 1, 2020, which resulted in a change to the\\nidentification of the goodwill reporting units. Previously, the reporting units were the same as the\\noperating segments for Electrification, Motion and Robotics & Discrete Automation, while for the\\nProcess Automation operating segment the reporting units were determined to be at the Division level,\\nwhich is one level below the operating segment. The new operating model provides the Divisions with\\nfull ownership and accountability for their respective strategies, performance and resources and based\\non these changes, the Company concluded that the reporting units would change and be the respective\\nDivisions within each operating segment. This change resulted only in an allocation of goodwill within\\nthe operating segments and thus there is no change to segment level goodwill in the table above.\\nAs a result of the new allocation of goodwill, an interim quantitative impairment test was conducted\\nboth before and after the changes which were effective July 1, 2020. In the \"before\" test, it was\\nconcluded that the fair value of the Company\\'s reporting units exceeded the carrying value under the\\nhistorical reporting unit structure.\\nThe impairment test was performed for the new reporting units and the fair value of each was\\ndetermined using a discounted cash flow fair value estimate based on objective information available at\\nthe measurement date. The significant assumptions used to develop the estimates of fair value for each\\nreporting unit included management\\'s best estimates of the expected future results and discount rates\\nspecific to the reporting unit. The fair value estimates were based on assumptions that the Company\\nbelieved to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and thus, actual results may differ from\\nthose estimates. The fair values for each of the individual reporting units and their associated goodwill\\nwere determined using Level 3 measurements.\\nThe interim quantitative impairment test indicated that the estimated fair values of the reporting units\\nwere substantially in excess of their carrying value for all reporting units except for the Machine\\nAutomation reporting unit within the Robotics & Discrete Automation operating segment. The\\ncontraction of the global economy in 2020, particularly in end-customer industries related to this\\nreporting unit and considerable uncertainty around the continued pace of macroeconomic recovery\\ngenerally led to a reduction in the fair values of the reporting units, thus affecting this reporting unit.\\nAlso, at the Division level, this reporting unit does not benefit from shared cash flows generated within\\nan entire operating segment. In addition, the book value of the Machine Automation Division\\nincludes a significant amount of intangible assets recognized in past acquisitions, resulting\\nin a proportionately higher book value than the other reporting unit within the Robotics & Discrete\\nAutomation Business Area. With the fair value of the reporting unit lower due to the economic\\nconditions, the existing book value of the intangible assets combined with the newly allocated\\nreporting unit goodwill led to the carrying value of the Machine Automation reporting unit exceeding its\\nfair value. During 2020, a goodwill impairment charge of $290 million was recorded to reduce the\\ncarrying value of this reporting unit to its implied fair value. The remaining goodwill for the Machine\\nAutomation reporting unit was $554 million as of December 31, 2020.\\nMotion Automation Automation',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\nDuring 2021, certain reporting units were split into separate reporting units. For each change, an\\ninterim quantitative impairment test was conducted before and after the change and in all cases, it was\\nconcluded that the fair value of the relevant reporting units exceeded the carrying value\\nby a significant amount.\\nAt October 1, 2021 and 2020, respectively, the Company performed qualitative assessments and\\ndetermined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value for each of these reporting units was\\nbelow the carrying value.

At the end of the\\nsavings period, employees choose whether to exercise their stock options using their savings plus\\ninterest, if any, to buy ABB Ltd shares (American Depositary Shares (ADS) in the case of employees in\\nthe United States and Canada-each ADS representing one registered share of the Company) at the\\nexercise price set at the grant date, or have their savings returned with any interest. The savings are\\naccumulated in bank accounts held by a third-party trustee on behalf of the participants and earn\\ninterest, where applicable. Employees can withdraw from the ESAP at any time during the savings\\nperiod and will be entitled to a refund of their accumulated savings.\\nThe fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the same option valuation model as\\ndescribed under the MIP, using the assumptions noted in the table below. The expected term of the\\noption granted has been determined to be the contractual one-year life of each option, at the end of\\nwhich the options vest and the participants are required to decide whether to exercise their options or\\nhave their savings returned with interest. The risk-free rate is based on one-year Swiss franc interest\\nrates, reflecting the one-year contractual life of the options.

In addition, for certain awards to vest, the participant has\\nto fulfill a three-year service condition as defined in the terms and conditions of the LTIP.\\nThe Performance Shares under the 2021, 2020 and 2019 LTIP launches include a performance\\ncomponent, based on the Company's earnings per share performance, and a market component, based\\non the Company's relative total shareholder return.\\nFor the relative total shareholder return component of the Performance Shares, the actual number of\\nshares that will be delivered at a future date is based on the Company's total shareholder return\\nperformance relative to a peer group of companies over a three-year period starting with the year of\\ngrant. The actual number of shares that will ultimately be delivered will vary depending on the relative\\ntotal shareholder return outcome achieved between a lower threshold (no shares delivered) and an\\nupper threshold (the number of shares delivered is capped at 200 percent of the conditional grant).\\nFor the earnings per share performance component of the Performance Shares, the actual number of\\nshares that will be delivered at a future date is based on the Company's average earnings per share over\\nthree financial years, beginning with the year of launch. The actual number of shares that will ultimately\\nbe delivered will vary depending on the earnings per share outcome as computed under each LTIP\\nlaunch, interpolated between a lower threshold (no shares delivered) and an upper threshold (the\\nnumber of shares delivered is capped at 200 percent of the conditional grant).\",\n",

The CODM allocates\\nresources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using the information outlined\\nbelow. The Company is organized into the following segments, based on products and services:\\nElectrification, Motion, Process Automation and Robotics & Discrete Automation. The remaining\\noperations of the Company are included in Corporate and Other.\\nEffective January 1, 2021, the Industrial Automation segment was renamed the Process Automation\\nsegment. In addition, the Company changed its method of allocating real estate assets to its operating\\nsegments whereby these assets are now accounted for directly in the individual operating segment\\nwhich utilizes the asset rather than as a cost recharged to the operating segment from Corporate and\\nOther. As a result, while this change had no impact on segment revenues or profits (Operational EBITA),\\ncertain real estate assets (including corresponding depreciation and capital expenditure), previously\\nreported within Corporate and Other have been allocated to the total segment assets of each individual\\noperating segment. Certain segment information for 2020 and 2019, as well as Total assets at\\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, have been recast to reflect this allocation change.',\n",

A keep-well agreement\\nis a shareholder agreement between the Company and a Group company. These agreements provide for\\nmaintenance of a minimum net worth in the Group company and the maintenance of 100% direct or\\nindirect ownership by the Company.\\nThe keep-well agreements additionally provide that if at any time the Group company has insufficient\\nliquid assets to meet any payment obligation on its debt (as defined in the agreements) and has\\ninsufficient unused commitments under its credit facilities with its lenders, the Company will make\\navailable to the Group company sufficient funds to enable it to fulfill such payment obligation as it falls\\ndue. A keep-well agreement is not a guarantee by the Company for payment of the indebtedness, or any\\nother obligation, of a Group company. No party external to the ABB Group is a party to any\\nkeep-well agreement.\\nThe Company has also provided certain guarantees securing the performance of Group companies in\\nconnection with commercial paper programs, indentures or other debt instruments to enable them to\\nfulfill the payment obligations under such instruments as they fall due.

The Company exercised its option in 2021 to extend the maturity of the\\nfacility to 2026. No amounts were drawn under this Group Facility at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\\nThe Company through certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries is involved in various regulatory and\\nlegal matters.

Since we are a global\\ncompany, the comparability of our operating\\nresults reported in U.S. dollars is affected by\\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We\\ncalculate the impacts from foreign currency\\nfluctuations by translating the current-year\\nperiods\\' reported key figures into U.S. dollar\\namounts using the exchange rates in effect for\\nthe comparable periods in the previous year.\\nComparable growth rates are also adjusted for\\nchanges in our business portfolio. Adjustments to\\nour business portfolio occur due to acquisitions,\\ndivestments, or by exiting specific business\\nactivities or customer markets. The adjustment\\nfor portfolio changes is calculated as follows:\\nwhere the results of any business acquired or\\ndivested have not been consolidated and reported\\nfor the entire duration of both the current and\\ncomparable periods, the reported key figures of\\nsuch business are adjusted to exclude the relevant\\nkey figures of any corresponding quarters which\\nare not comparable when computing the compa-\\nrable growth rate. Certain portfolio changes\\nwhich do not qualify as divestments under U.S.\\nGAAP have been treated in a similar manner to\\ndivestments. Changes in our portfolio where we\\nhave exited certain business activities or cus-\\ntomer markets are adjusted as if the relevant\\nbusiness was divested in the period when the\\ndecision to cease business activities was taken.\\nWe do not adjust for portfolio changes where the\\nrelevant business has annualized revenues of less\\nthan $50 million.\\n## Operational EBITA margin\\nOperational EBITA margin\\nOperational EBITA margin is Operational EBITA\\nas a percentage of Operational revenues.\\n### Operational EBITA\\nOperational earnings before interest, taxes and\\nacquisition-related amortization (Operational\\nEBITA) represents Income from operations\\nexcluding:\\n· acquisition-related amortization (as defined\\nbelow),\\n· restructuring, related and implementation costs\\n(as defined below),\\n· changes in the amount recorded for obligations\\nrelated to divested businesses occurring after\\nthe divestment date (changes in obligations\\nrelated to divested businesses),\\n· changes in estimates relating to opening\\nbalance sheets of acquired businesses (changes\\nin pre-acquisition estimates),\\n· gains and losses from sale of businesses\\n(including fair value adjustment on assets and\\nliabilities held for sale),\\n· acquisition- and divestment-related expenses\\nand integration costs,\\n. other income/expense relating to the Power\\nGrids joint venture,\\n· certain other non-operational items, as well as\\n· foreign exchange/commodity timing\\ndifferences in income from operations\\nconsisting of: (a) unrealized gains and losses on\\nderivatives (foreign exchange, commodities,\\nembedded derivatives), (b) realized gains and\\nlosses on derivatives where the underlying\\nhedged transaction has not yet been realized,\\nand (c) unrealized foreign exchange movements\\non receivables/payables (and related assets/\\nliabilities).',\n",
